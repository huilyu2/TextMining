In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share. Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year. He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a share falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share. Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share. In 1988 Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone." President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.

Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1 mln shares changing hands by late afternoon. "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder " an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer announced before the opening today expires March 25. "This is totally by surprise " said Debra Strohmaier a ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready. She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials. "I think they will resist it " said Elliott Schlang analyst at Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that doesn't like a surprise attack would." Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management. Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested. ChemLawn with about two mln customers is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes. Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to another company that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system. Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed. Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter. Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice. Reuter

110,TRAIN,false,true,AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF,American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8 up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson according to analysts. Yesterday Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer Jeffery Lane to the added position of president which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts however disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson " said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very profitable securities firm." Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization " said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road " said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis. "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future which goes heavily into the international arena " said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way " he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson its stock might better reflect other assets such as the travel related services business. "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company " he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST> in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns share analysts said making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier an arms and chemicals group to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies Atlas Copco &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.

Lundberg a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>. During 1986 the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.

Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N> which currently holds a 50.1 pct and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs. The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled. Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit which provided computer software for the financial services community. RMJ Securities had offices in New York where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day and in London where it has 15 billion.

He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year equal to 26 cents per share adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post the leading English language newspaper compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd> itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares. The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish. Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

362,TRAIN,false,true,AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS,American Express Co rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson but the plan was considered highly unlikely analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however the need for added capital is puzzling. "(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to " said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added previously vacant post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm however that the financial services firm which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage. Reuter

372,TRAIN,false,true,PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH>,New Jersey-based overnight messenger Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company. Hutton LBO a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc will be majority owner of the company. Hutton said the acquiring company PC Acquisition Inc is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing Purolator's U.S. courier operations. If all the shares of Purolator are tendered shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash six dlrs in debentures and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations. Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs. This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs and previously sold its auto filters business. Purolator retains its Stant division which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business its president Warren Idsal said. "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future " said Idsal. William Taggart chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division will be chief executive officer of the new company. The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions. The offer will begin Thursday subject to clearances from the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire 20 business days after commencement unless extended. Reuter

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Redstone who controls Dedham Mass. -based National Amusements Inc a theater chain operator offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. The Redstone offer which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover. Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom. The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. The Redstone group which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom and the management group which has a 5.4 pct stake have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. In his SEC filing Redstone who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs Redstone said. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier Redstone said. Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6 881 800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash he said. The new offer the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents he said. Last week the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company.

714,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA>,A bidding war for Viacom International Inc one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20 days from the day we mail " said the source. The source predicted National Amusements controlled by investor Sumner Redstone would need "half a year" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think we're at the end now in terms of bidding " said the firm's arbitrageur who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the company " one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC> which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share dipped to nine dlrs and is now just over 30 dlrs. Last week Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs. Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN> which owns a stake in Warner rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4. Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>. The company has 940 000 cable television subscribers operates nine satellite television services and owns television and radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films and other programs for television. Reuter

730,TRAIN,true,true,ICI &lt;ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES,Imperial Chemical Industries PLC the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year and better its 1986 results said chairman-elect Denys Henderson. "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base " Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company ICI Pharma which with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not." ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990 ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits. "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return " said A.W. Clements finance director of ICI who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually were Statil a treatment for diabetic complications Zoladex a treatment for advanced prostate cancer and Carwin a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK> is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive." Henderson said that in his new role of chairman effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

748,TRAIN,false,true,PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI> BID,Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders including the biggest investor the Bass family of Texas. However the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer he said. Pesch in an interview with Reuters said based on the conversations he held with shareholders he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said however there is support for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock. Earlier today Wedge Group which has a 5.5 pct stake said it held discussions with Pesch American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and appropriate at this time." "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share " said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical but it would not rule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch. Pesch who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition. Republic also has substantial debt and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm another cause for concern to Wall Street. However Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group. "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment " Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts compared to a 95 ct loss last year. Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. "I think it's much more doable " he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs. Reuter

There had been speculation another offer might be forthcoming but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc is fully valued. Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday. Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share. analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday. Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser Dillon Read and Co since late December a Hutton spokesman said. Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the shares. If all shares are tendered shareholders would receive 29 dlrs cash six dlrs in debentures and warrants for stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S. courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton.

During the takeeover attempt a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired. In addition a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys who asked not to be identified said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering. A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe. The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers. A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe. The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time. "To the best of our knowledge Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid he said. A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added: "We had nothing to do with TRE." As a matter of policy the SEC routinely declines to comment on its enforcement activities. Reuter

It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd> permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs it said.

922,TRAIN,true,false,CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS,CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1 making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985 against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1 dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id. The company operates on a substituted tax year not the fiscal year ending June 30 and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings CRA said in a statement. Consequently it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout it said. Despite the higher net earnings CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined with supply and demand in better balance but overcapacity continues CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985 it said. Lead zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985 CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax included in the net interest cost. REUTER

They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau Evergo's executive director declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels." Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel one of Asia's best known hotels and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake. "It is purely coincidence " he said. But analysts were not so certain saying that the Evergo group which has a reputation as a corporate raider may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles. "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family " said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun Evergo China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates Ltd>.

Very good progress was made last year while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come. Earlier Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg level with the year earlier period making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year. Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1 1987. Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2 575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts dealers added. REUTER

The spokesman reacting to Irish and British press reports said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium nor has he been buying shares." He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile. In the magazine article he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts. "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation " he said. "This would mean an expensive exercise right on the edge but not impossible " he added.

Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about 45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its business including adjustments to reflect the market value of transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves for inventory receivables and excess facilities. Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will also include restructuring costs of about 5 500 000 dlrs in addition to the 45 mln dlr charge. Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating in technical default under its lease of transponders on the Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain agreed-upon financial ratios. It said it is in talks with the lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations. Further Equitorial said it is in default of two other oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of transponders as a result of cross-default provisions. Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial master earth stations micro earth stations and associated equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month period for repayment starting in December 1988.

Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy about 3 600 000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each. Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and lessors in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease. It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15. Equatorial in 1985 earned 1 807 000 dlrs after a 3 197 000 dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln dlrs.

He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses had now been completed he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on with strategic acquisitions taking place "from time to time " he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms however profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However it would not add much to profits with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S. Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.

Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986 it said. A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements. Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets. The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln. Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.

Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices " and also continued to add to its general provisions for loans to troubled borrower countries. The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter. The bank said non-accrual loans net of provisions for loan losses totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31 up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago. In reporting lower first quarter earnings chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings. Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their potential impact on the Royal Bank.

"Healthy consumer credit growth record fee-based income highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses should lead to improved results in the periods ahead " chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending particularly residential mortgages. Reuter

Howard Harlow analyst at Whale Securities Corp said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX a micrographics firm from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>. "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987 maybe as much as a dlr a share because of DatagraphiX " Harlow said. "Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half." Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX Harlow said. A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986. Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs " Harlow added. Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31 up from 301 000 dlrs or one ct a share.

1252,TRAIN,true,false,GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER,One of General Electric Co's biggest businesses aircraft engines will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs Wall Street analysts said. Previously it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order " said Nicholas Heymann analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm General Electric Financial Services Inc would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole the deal appears to pose little risk for GE Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625 000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one order will have much of an effect on the stock." Russell Leavitt analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc said the order "will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year with well over half of the business in the military sector according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and reshape it pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter in part crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition." Reuter

Woolworth Co once known only as a five and dime store chain which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct. It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago. Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion. For the fourth quarter the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs. Roy Garofalo Woolworth vice president told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits. He said the company now has 4 700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year it operated 4 100 specialty stores Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place a discount drug health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1 700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide of which 1 200 are in the United States. Harold Sells chairman and chief executive of Woolworth said in a statement "These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings." Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period. Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's Woolworth opened a discount general store chain Woolco and J. Brannam a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985 however Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores. Reuter

Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs or 1.05 dlrs per share compared to 125.8 mln dlrs or 84 cts per share a year ago. Operating earnings however were off about four pct and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. "It is in a soft market now but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share " Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted however the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts " Beall said adding "long-term we have a very serious problem." In addition Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S. Reuter

If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co &lt;WTC> B.C.

The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C.

Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8 to 31-1/2 Tuesday. A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has 4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go for control of the whole company. An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the rumor. The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up to 40 dlrs a share or for a total of 680 mln dlrs. A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available. Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be triggered when a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership. Wayne Jones vice president at Outboard for strategic planning said management wants to stay independent. "We are not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our strategic plans " he said. That plan includes integrating five boat companies that Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs. An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a "decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops " he said. Outboard which has 17 mln shares outstanding is in registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan Stanley Inc. It makes sense the analyst said for Sun Chemical to strike before the offering is underway. Reuter

1682,TRAIN,true,false,TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>,General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. "I'm very positive on GM " said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value." However some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet " he said since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76 he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988 compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors " he said. In late February GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986 analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter which will help GM finance the buyback. "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds " he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today in part in reaction to the announced buyback and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler " he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend currently five dlrs a share annually which gives it a higher yield than its competitors Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken and GM's new products if successful will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. "I believe their new cars will be successful but that will only curtail losses in market share " which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990 Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock he said results will not improve until 1988. "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM " he said. Fricke who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important." Reuter

1696,TRAIN,true,false,TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS,French oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss including minority interests for 1986 after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs the company said in a communique after a board meeting here. In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation turning a consolidated net profit before losses on stocks of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA> told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations " Guilbaud said. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6 000 this year and 5 000 in 1988 from 6 800 last year under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs he said. Concerning business in 1987 he said that "January was a good month but the situation deteriorated in February." Reuter

1718,TRAIN,true,false,PACTEL &lt;PAC> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH,Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs or 5.02 dlrs per share earned in 1986. Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986 and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial spending will be internally financed. Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company. In rates hearings before the California Public Utility Commission Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr revenue reduction and due to ongoing discussions with the commission he said the figure might even be greater. The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found 180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs. Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan. "We have not agreed to anything " Guinn said but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating. Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services Guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion. "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business. It's a commodity business and becoming more so " he said. "I'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business." However Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies. He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration " he said. Reuter

Redstone 63 catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid. "We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel " Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will be a company expense " Redstone said. He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs. After the merger Viacom will be a subsidiary of National but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands. Reuter

1836,TRAIN,false,true,TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION,Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or alternatively to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else " said one arbitrager. "We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon." Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer " said Timothy Pettee a Bear Stearns analyst. "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals " said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8 also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines " said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. "I don't know whose going to buy them but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package " said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement " said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont dominant in the southeast to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share. Reuter

1860,TRAIN,true,true,ALLIS-CHALMERS &lt;AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING,Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock. The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds. Under the plan which was presented to institutional lenders the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company. Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting dilution of the existing common stock " Allis-Chalmers said in a statement. Under the plan holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common. Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors common and preferred holders and present and former employees. Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached." The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring. "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions he said. Also under the plan payments to Allis-Chalmers' private lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met. Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made "at substantially reduced levels." Allis-Chalmers once one of the leading farm equipment companies sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks air conditioning fluids handling and solid materials processing. Last year Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus Ohio. Under the restructuring plan Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses. Solid materials processing which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs. The company will also sell its fluids handling operations which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues. Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985 the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs or 12.27 dlrs a share.

Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985 adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986 when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand as their loan portfolio is well balanced " an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986 compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade the mainstay of the local economy rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986 but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks " one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and Co> analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter " an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd> of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time.

1920,TRAIN,false,true,HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER,The directors of Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today. Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M. Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger. Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger but decided against it. The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice requirement that Baker sell off several specialised subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling. The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement. The board of directors of the California-based Baker had approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries. The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with the Justice Department requirement Kerridge said.

Late yesterday Hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by Hughes. Hughes' board had previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent decree that would have required broader divestitures. Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice Department consent decree. Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal. Baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger. Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the merger as an alternative to the consent decree were "more burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves. Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs or three pct. Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of the units named in the consent decree. It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary damages it did not name. Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best interests of shareholders of both companies. Reuter

The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional." USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger. The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly. USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont. "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests." USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont. The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

2001,TRAIN,true,false,JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES,Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K. Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25 000 of its total 47 000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods John Egan said. In the longer term capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p down from 611p at yesterday's close after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations dealers said.

2061,TRAIN,true,false,ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER,Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods Shell chairman Peter Holmes said. The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg. The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume. Although the figures were lower they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading Plc &lt;SC.L> shares the U.K. Arm of the group rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985. Also a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted. However he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987 due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986. The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag analysts said. Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all. Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader Holmes added. Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity. "Exploration is currently pretty flat. We are going to go on but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn " he said. A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel. Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. "If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything " he noted. U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel. This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down. "OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction " he added. Reuter

2118,TRAIN,false,true,SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING,Securities and Exchange Commission chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping insider trading but the chairman of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about conditions on Wall Street. "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations have become easy prey " Rep. Edward Markey D-Mass the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities. "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come " Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing." Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment high fines and disbarment from the securities industry. "Insider trading has not been eradicated but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders " Shad said in his statement. Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years. Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts. N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo the senior subcommittee Republican said he was introducing legislation to create a five member commission to study the securities industry for a year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Commission members would be appointed by the SEC. "Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy of existing surveillance systems and government oversight operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws " Rinaldo said. Reuter

The department said the acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public interest. The department had given its tentative approval of the acquisition in January. The department said it decided to make final its tentative decision after reviewing the public response to it. The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North America which currently is not operating but plans to start service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA that the acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those markets by other carriers. The agency said Air North America provided no support for its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers monopoly power in some markets.

The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles San Diego San Francico Phoenix and Tucsonm the agency said.

"We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days " Shad told members of the House Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee when asked for his recommendation. He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide full disclosure for securities including junk bonds and not to make decisions based on merit. He said junk bonds had some value because of their liquidity. Shad said he opposes proposals to require those attempting takeovers to file a statement on the impact the takeover would have on the communities involved. "We've opposed it in the past.

Kistler said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the best interests of both companies. "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is good for both companies " Kistler said of the proposed merger that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service company. "We're working very hard on this merger." Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11 to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal. The Hughes board which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be " Kistler said in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. "We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal." Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was not a factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too "unreasonable." Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies. Reuter

SOGENAL founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982 is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria Belgium Luxembourg East and West Germany and Switzerland. Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur would be between 110 and 130 francs. Societe Generale which will itself be privatised later this year will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank Chairman Marc Vienot said. SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985. SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal. The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange in line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a regional operation Geronimus said. He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30 000 to 35 000 against the 12 500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. "This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France " he said. Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of 120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs. Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce its existing strong points with no major projects planned apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch. SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria it set up the first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its Strasbourg headquarters in 1985 and is the only foreign banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

"We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the quarter " James Treybig president and and chief executive officer told a meeting of securities analysts. In the second fiscal quarter last year Tandem earned 9 950 000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln dlrs. Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for the first quarter of fiscal 1987 when Tandem earned 27.1 mln dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is traditionally slower than the first. L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per share. For the full year he said he expects the computer maker to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986 Tandem earned 1.44 dlrs a share. Treybig who founded the Cupertino Calif.-based company said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United States. "The U.S. economy is picking up and buying decisions are being made. We didn't see that a year ago " he said. The executive said Tandem will increase its research and development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986. He said the company plans to introduce several products including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL programming language an industry standard.

2375,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE>,Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963 000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged. "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal " speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers however believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir they said is the least likely to be bought. Icahn who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. "You can't discount him " said one arbitrager. Analysts however said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer. "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing " said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately. "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work " said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger TWA would have to be the surviving entity analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA. Reuter

The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when Hughes management balking at the terms of a government consent decree offered a counter-proposal to Baker. Earlier today Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker. Hughes chairman W.A.

Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was possible between the two giant oilfield service companies. "The company's position is we would like to see the merger be completed which is in the best interests of our shareholders and their shareholders " Mattson said. "Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the litigation I can't go any further than that " he said. Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent decree.

The company's specialties and services segment cut its losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs. Eliminations of business conducted between the company's industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter 1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six mln dlrs in the year. The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year. Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501 mln dlrs.

2475,TRAIN,false,true,HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT,A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> Wall Street analysts said. Last night Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said it was still interested in the merger. The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its troubles could make it a takeover candidate. There was speculation today that Harold Simmons the Dallas investor might try to acquire Hughes but Simmons told Reuters he is not interested. Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the target other than to rule out Hughes. One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR> which owns 18.5 pct of Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere who serves on the Hughes board is believed to favor the merger with Baker. Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a merger and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going. "I think the merger is not going through " said Phil Pace analyst at Kidder Peabody and Co. He said the merger "lost a lot of its appeal" when the U.S. Department of Justice required that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation. Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes Pace said "30 to 40 pct of the cost savings are tied up in that." "They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit " said James Crandell analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position I don't know. "It's getting a little confusing " said James Carroll analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak." Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22 the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer period of time. Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale. Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs. Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed "the outlook for the industry has improved materially." Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting.

ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial advisor Smith Barney Harris Upham And Co Inc to seek other purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value. ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan or "poison pill " during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other purchasers. ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste Management in federal court in Columbus seeking injunctive and other relief. The suit alleges among other things that certain Waste Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules. Last week Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs. ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees suppliers creditors and customers. "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their shares to Waste Management " said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen. ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect shareholders against abusive tactics such as "market accumulations by Waste Management or others." Under the plan one comon stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn common. ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its commmon other than by an all cash tender offer for all its shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board. It said the rights expire July three 1987 or 60 days after they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time prior to their exercise date. ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer. It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record March 20. Reuter

The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1 mln dlr settlement of class action law suits. About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is contingent on court approval after notice to class members it said. The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges including bribery and false statement except for conspiracy to which Paradyne pleaded guilty. The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the government's suspension the dismissal of the federal civil false claims suit and all charges against the individuals. Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for the civil settlement 750 000 dlrs will go to settle a derivative lawsuit. For the year ended December 31 Paradyne reported a net loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today. Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and chief executive officer succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the settlement of the indictment. Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and chief operating officer. The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is optimistic about the outlook for the year. For the first quarter of 1986 the company reported net income of 875 000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs. Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security Administration. The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government officials and defaud the Social Security Administration. Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Under the settlement announced today federal prosecutors agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement. The charges would then be dropped if the defendants successfully complete the probation period. Details of the requirements in the agreement were not immediately available. Reuter

Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd> Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment for Dome and we have no intention of selling it." Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares. He also declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling it shares. "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of Dome Mines stock) are very attractive " Annesley commented. "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs " he added. A price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairly attractive " Annesley said. Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be an opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be virtually a control block in Dome Mines " he said. Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs off 1/4 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56 major creditors which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.

The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 -- was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan. The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986. Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for the shares although it expected to buy them back itself. The statement said the sale did not represent any withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main shareholders. Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main shareholders it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln crowns until a new equity issue could be made. Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue. Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results. Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra 170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken another major creditor and shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner &lt;Industrivarden AB>. The share price was to be 20 crowns.

2742,TRAIN,true,false,ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR,Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS> chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar. Hazelhoff speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties namely the future trend of the dollar the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently. He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off. REUTER

Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln dlr transaction Monday. Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the transaction on March 16 as scheduled if it is approved by shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change. Explaining its request for the amendment Siemens informed Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters. Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations and warranties are true. Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information which would make its representations and warranties untrue. Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The 65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset. A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this 21 mln dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year on the anniversary date of the transaction. He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months. Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of certain intercompany debt until completion of the review.

The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending litigation between the parties Lucky Stores said. The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against Lucky Stores and its directors the company said. In addition the standstill provisions also apply to Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders the company said. Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting power of substantial Lucky stockholders. Edelman who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company. Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own common shares and reincorporation in Delaware. The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co a chain of 324 retail stores was one of the key parts of the restructuring program. Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed reincorporation which was a condition of the repurchase and restructuring plan. Under this latest arrangement Lucky Stores said it agreed to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of out-of-pocket expenses which include litigation and other costs. "This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and the accompanying demands on management time " Lucky Stores chairman John Lillie said in a statement.

2792,TRAIN,true,false,ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS,American Telephone and Telegraph Co's proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates but it should help the company's profits analysts said. "Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large volume users but status quo for residential users " said PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman. But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has constrained the company's profits in the long distance business leading to higher profit margins analysts said. ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance business the profits of which have been limited by a regulated rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct. Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal Communications Commission to scrap the formula cut the amount of time needed to approve rate proposals and leave it up to its competitors to oppose it filings. MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing yesterday saying greater the moves would increase competition in the telephone business. Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in the long-distance unit and increase its profit margins previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in the industry simply because of the competition the phone industry giant faces. "You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline " said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. "But you wouldn't see a rise." Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to selectively raise or lower prices depending on the market. "It will give ATT a lot more flexibility " he said. ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC hearings. It may face at least one strong opponent U.S. Sprint the long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>. "We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it " a U.S. Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed to greater competition. It may also take some time for the proposals to go through and in the process they may be altered by the various constituencies affected by the move. "There's so much complexity so much inertia so much bureacracy that stricly speaking about the mechanisms it won't happen that fast " said analyst Victor Krueger of the Gartner Group. Reuter

The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild Industries officials to inform them "that they do not believe management has been successful in enhancing or protecting shareholder values."

Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to Commerce Bank estimated last year at 947 mln Canadian dlrs and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to pay down debt analysts said. "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset " said one analyst who asked not to be named. Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor Energy but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale "at the right price." Dome now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10 billion dlrs in debt sees Encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell spokesman David Annesley said. The Encor shares do not pay dividends. A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake. At current market prices Dome's stake in Encor would be valued at about 308 mln dlrs while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs. Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the Canadian oil and gas producer analysts said. "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices " Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented. "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years " he added. Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 7-1/8 near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six dlrs in early February. The company also recently set up its own operating management which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented. Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So (the sale) does make a lot of sense " Mote said. However analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to Commerce Bank. "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as they can " said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber. Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to block such a sale arguing they have a claim on company assets. "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them " said analyst Gobert. Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration. Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines. Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's holding. Presumably a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company's debt obligations connected with Dome Petroleum Gobert said. Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very attractive."

USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to buy up to 3 491 030 new shares under certain circumstances. Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding. USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain control of Piedmont. The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to Piedmont shareholders but it said it could cut the number of shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent. USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be satisfied. In that case it said if more than that minimum number of shares were tendered it would buy shares on a pro rata basis. In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in cash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir shares for each remaining Piedmont share. Last week Carl C. Icahn-controlled Trans World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share a bid that was rejected by the USAir board. The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWA's application to acquire USAir on the grounds that the application failed to comply with department regulations by omitting necessary information. TWA said it would refile today providing the information needed. On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln shares or 15 pct of USAir. Reuter

In a newspaper advertisement MTS said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended. Sosnoff a New York investor already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding or about 13.3 pct and is Caesars' largest shareholder. Caesars owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN> which owns an Atlantic City N.J. casino hotel.

For all of fiscal 1986 the company earned 41.0 mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.

MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM> has committed to lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing for the transaction. It said its financial adviser PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has stated in writing that subject to market conditions it is highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475 mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing. MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared. In June 1986 Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World board a request that has not yet been granted. In September 1986 Sosnoff who is chairman of &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp> filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct. Sosnoff said in a letter to Caesars World chairman and chief executive officer Henry Gluck that "The decision to go directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may financial and legal advisors who repeatedly stressed to me the lack of responsiveness of the management in the past." Sosnoff who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat. "My advisers felt that had I given you advance notice you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration " he said. Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him. "As I have indicated publicly in the past I believe operating management of the company has performed well and that appropriate consideration should be given to a significant equity interest for them in the company following the acquisition " Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck. MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election or removal of directors.

3062,TRAIN,true,false,SOUTHERN &lt;SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST,Southern Co said it will take an after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers in Georgia will be asked to pay. The company's largest subsidiary Georgia Power Co said the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct or 522 mln dlrs to 8.87 billion. However because of a pledge the made last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission the increased cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric rates. Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September 1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete it added. The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a full-power license. The nuclear power plant located near Waynesboro Ga. is co-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp> the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was due to several factors including additional labor costs incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the first change in the plant's budget since August 1985 when it was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs. In March 1986 the utility told Georgia regulators it would "cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay at 3.56 billion dlrs the company's share of the then projected 8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget Georgia Power said its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs. Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is 313 mln dlrs Southern said this will result in a charge against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes. In addition the company said Georgia Power's contracts with the joint owners require the utility to buy back significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs it will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase that applies to the buybacks. This bings the total amount that must be charged against earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes Southern said. Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting Standards Board which are effective in January 1988 require any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged against earnings once that determination is made. The company also said its board has approved a capital budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987 including work on the Vogtle project. It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting noting this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years 1986-1988.

Last year Dart Group owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books competed against Kohlberg Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc. The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company. The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs according to analysts. Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.

"My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out " said Ballan. Analysts however said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations which might make it difficult to thwart a bid. Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis. For the first quarter Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987. "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily due to Purity Supreme in New England " Comeau said. He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations. Rickels a home center business has faced problems due to the state of that industry and has reported lower returns as an operating unit according to analysts. Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company's operations.

3267,TRAIN,false,true,USX &lt;X> CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR LOWER DOLLAR,USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit which last year reached 170 billion dlrs. In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit Roderick said "There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery." Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the "economic pain" our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar. But he added "As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable lengthy and steep world recession." Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations. At the end of 1986 he said the value of foreign assets in the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX. The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 although other factors were involved Roderick said. But it is wrong he said "to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product quality." These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem Roderick said. He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets. In the speech the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators. Among his proposals which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company. Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made. Further raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's stock he said. And payment of greenmail or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake should be prohibited under the revised laws. Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage "fair price to all" takeovers. Reuter

They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at 782 mln dlrs paid in cash notes and Chrysler shares. The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities though the latter is not included valuing the transaction. Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed purchase of its much-smaller rival but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in Chrysler's earnings. A Chrysler financial source speaking anonymously told Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it would have been had a deal been struck last year because the impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards accumulated from its losses since 1980. "There were very serious discussions last fall but we didn't pull it off " the source said in a reference to the assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges Besse. "It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor. And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done it before the end of last year." In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities the source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps which he called "an overhang to the company." Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest 35 mln dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary 25 mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with the acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid AMC shareholders. "The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption " analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters. Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12 billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal. But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's liabilities his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC debt that is being carried at "non-market" rates. He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the previous Renault management on the acquisition because they were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an integral part.

Takeuchi said sales are expected to fall 40 pct to 1 700 billion yen for the fifth consecutive year-on-year drop. This year's fall was due to lower selling prices for end-users which more than offset the yen's appreciation. The company will retain six yen dividend for 1986/87. REUTER

3490,TRAIN,true,false,ULTRAMAR SAYS FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS,Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view several special charges adversely affected results. Overall the year had not been a good one with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories. But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery. The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985. The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada's marketing assets. Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation. The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term. Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery. In the meantime Ultramar's objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base. Proven probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis. Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last night's close.

But profits "will be at a satisfactory level " the company said in the annual report without giving a specific estimate. Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be offset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its exports as the year progresses. Highveld said measures taken last year by the European Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South African steel products "presents a challenge to management to place the steel in other areas." The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987 is expected to be similar to last year although China's role is still an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation. "World vanadium production capacity is still believed to be adequate to cater for any foreseeable demand " it added. REUTER
3505,TRAIN,true,false,PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN,A spokesman for Preussag AG &lt;PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986 adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985 helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks it said without giving comparison figures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94 400 tonnes in 1986 while foreign oil production rose to 182 900 tonnes from 174 500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary whose results are included in the world group accounts made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year. AMC's large losses in 1985 caused principally by the international tin crisis were the reason behind the world group losses that year. REUTER

The 1985 dividend was 10 pct unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier. Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986 against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad particularly in Latin America had lowered profits Androsch said but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total. In an attempt to generate more foreign business representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo Hong Kong Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2 008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt Austria's largest bank holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies.

Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres. Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss 171.2 mln in 1982.

The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion. The new Outokumpu division called Copper Products Industry is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production plants including its two U.S. Subsidiaries &lt;Nippert Co> and &lt;Valleycast Inc> as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo. Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's copper tube production into one of the new division's profit centres.

3645,TRAIN,false,true,CHRYSLER &lt;C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS,Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to takeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster the small automaker's sales but it leaves the future of its 19 000 employees in doubt industry analysts say. It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motors headquarters one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault according to company spokesman Edd Snyder. But AMC's future to be discussed at a board meeting today would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if it had continued with the state-run French car group as its controlling shareholder. Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly plant in Kenosha Wis. and its Toledo Ohio Jeep plant would be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass. Both plants are far from "state of the art" for car manufacturing sites and AMC has a history of poor labor relations at each. "Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants " said Michael Luckey automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson Lehman Brothers. "They probably will close the Toledo plant and move Jeep production to Canada." Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the very least the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union local representing Jeep workers. "The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they have AMC because during a down year Chrysler will have underutilized facilities to transfer production " he said. Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that would abort a combination which historians said would be the auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed in 1954. AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the earliest. In announcing the takeover agreement Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln dlr assembly plant at Bramalea Ontario and its network of 1 200 dealers as the major attractions. Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur in the AMC buyout.

"This is a matter that is being looked into " Charles Rule acting assistant attorney general-antitrust told the Senate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee. Rule declined further comment while the review was continuing. Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) who had asked why the department was not acting against "what appears to be a clear violation of the law." Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15 mln dlrs' worth of USAir stock. But Rule said that for airline companies a purchaser would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Icahn filed such an application with the DOT but the filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday. The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it lacked the necessary data for the government to review the proposed USAir takeover bid. Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday. Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violation were found. Reuter

Analyst Theodore Semegran of Shearson said he raised his earnings estimates for the company to 7.25 dlrs a share in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988. The company earned 6.35 dlrs a share in 1986. "Good domestic demand higher operating earnings and a strng export business probably benefitting from a lower dollar and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to aid Du Pont." He also noted that energy earnings in the first quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude prices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year. He also expects the company to raise its annual dividend about 20 to 30 cts a share from its current dividend of 3.20 dlrs a share "and a stock split is possible but it has a low probablility."

3779,TRAIN,false,true,BELGIAN MINISTER UNVEILS PRIVATISATION PLAN,Belgian Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several state-owned enterprises including national airline Sabena and the postal and telecommunications authority government sources said. They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's projections helping the government to reduce its huge budget deficit targetted this year at 418 billion francs. But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the Social Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday. Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult the sources said. Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last quarter of 1987 with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three billion francs they added. A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5 billion francs while 50 pct of the postal and telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in mid-1990 and early 1992 raising at least seven billion francs. Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime Transport Authority leading gas distributor Distrigaz CGER savings bank CGER and several other credit institutions.

Boone Pickens may be targeting the company for an acquisition traders and analysts said. Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment to make whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment. Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco. Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4. Paul Feretti an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard Weil Labouisse Friedrichs Inc said he was not surprised at market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover attempt. "It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his group may be interested " Feretti said. "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a challenge." Pickens who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter has made no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet analysts said. Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at 58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of about 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive to Pickens." Other analysts however estimate a breakup value well into the 60 dlr a share range. "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile takeover " Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst John Olson said putting little credence in the rumors. "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said the buyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems" Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy businesses. Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer such as spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to shareholders buy back shares or create a limited partnership out of its natural gas pipeline interests. An analyst who asked to remain unidentified discouraged the Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with his holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess " he said. "I don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems with Case (the farm equipment unit) which has been losing about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion dlrs on the market today."

Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold. An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business. Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger. Hughes' Kistler speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period. Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting if necessary an additional three-month extension to complete the sale. He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic drilling bit business. The companies Kistler said have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore. Kistler estimated that the merger which should be completed in about two weeks will result in annual cost savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial cutbacks" in the 20 000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc the name the merged company will take.

Instead merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are after all the proprietors of the company " Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale integration and more efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested " he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term partly or even primarily at the expense of the future " he said. Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market and give rise to temptations on both sides of the battle to engage in aggressive even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders " he said. In a clear reference recent events he said "those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must I suggest be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result." They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated.

4067,TRAIN,true,false,SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD,Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said "The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money." The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures &lt;United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi> known as Saudi French slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez increased provisions sharply. &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions." From 1982 to 1985 the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985 &lt;Riyad Bank> NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank> 40 pct owned by the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East> are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good." Reflecting the caution in new lending the amount of advances is showing a declining trend while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979 the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account. REUTER

4074,TRAIN,true,false,JAPANESE CORPORATE EARNINGS RECOVERY PREDICTED,Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9 pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in three years partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate the Nomura research institute said. Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in the year which starts April 1 the research arm of Nomura Securities Co said in a statement.

Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation such as cutting production costs are expected to bear fruit next fiscal year the institute said. The economy should also benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a halt in rising prices of manufactured goods it said. Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct fall in the current year.

Rowntree expects North American operations will this year ahead of company expectations be of the same order as those from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined the statement said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast. Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide including further moves in the speciality retailing business which Rowntree first entered in 1983 the statement said. Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging. The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business Holgates raised earnings 10-fold the statement said. Offsetting factors included currency movements which cost the company nearly 5.0 mln stg.

Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's leisure industry health and communications activities Monod said. In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee &lt;CMI.PA> Club Med of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France he said. Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex he said. He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years. Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France. Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln Monod said.

Total investment by the group in the communications sector including cable activities would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years mainly concentrated in the coming year. Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years with the aim of widening the audience to 280 000 subscribers from 12 000 and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.

Instead merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are after all the proprietors of the company " Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale integration and more efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested " he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term partly or even primarily at the expense of the future " he said. Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market and give rise to temptations on both sides of the battle to engage in aggressive even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders " he said. In a clear reference recent events he said "those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must I suggest be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result." They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated.

4132,TRAIN,true,false,JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR,Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction company president Klaus Jacobs said. The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs. Jacobs said the increase in profit which far exceeded the company's target of five pct real annual growth had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl general director in charge of economic affairs said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand especially in France and West Germany. Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985 largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct. Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future. Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year. REUTER

The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1 544 000 dlrs compared with a 1985 profit of 3 912 000 dlrs. Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt service payments a 1 743 000 dlr loan on one of its Houston properties is due to mature on April One. Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted. It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which if granted would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels. The loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other litigation connected with the specific properties involved and could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments to some of the lenders. Southwest said if the attempts to restructure debt do not succeed it could lose one or more of the properties. Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per share down from 16.68 dlrs a year before. The company said depending on the success of the talks and operating results for 1987 one or two more properties could become subject to similar negotiations.

The officials who asked not to be named said yesterday that Baldrige has "serious concerns" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd. another major electronics firm.

Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies.

The stock consolidation "is something we're discussing but it's not definite " Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner told Reuters in an interview. A private placement recently brought the number of outstanding shares to 106 mln up from 97.1 mln shares on July 31 1986 the fiscal yearend. "The company has always had the aura of a penny stock " Shattner said adding that Sand plans at some time to apply for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange. Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of five pct or about 350 000 dlrs on sales of seven mln dlrs for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third quarter should be about the same as the second he added. Last year Sand lost 243 064 dlrs on revenues of 7 012 195 dlrs in the second quarter. After "a disastrous first quarter " Sand hopes to break even in the current fiscal year Shattner said. The company has scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs from the 33.5 mln dlrs projected in December. The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs or two cts per share on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year the company lost 1 350 387 dlrs or one ct per share on sales of 3 570 585 dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results this year due to several factors. "Last year one of our biggest problems was we were buying products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the second quarter " he said. Sand Technology sells under its trademark computer accessories such as disk drives solid-state memory enhancement devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT> of Japan. Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit ST Systems Inc is developing software that lets large maniframe computers handle large databases and share them between applications. It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens which is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major corporations. The company has also reduced costs through some staff cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff instead of straight commissions Shattner said.

K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from "merchandising refurbishing and expense control." A year ago K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago. K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of these programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes to 1.03 billion dlrs the first time K Mart Corp has reached this milestone." Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8 billion dlrs an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over 1985 it said. Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise "a marked increase in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from specialty retailing operations." K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs a 32.3 pct gain from 372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8 pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in 1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct. K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling general and administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct in 1985. "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K Mart " Fauber said in a statement. "In the years immediately prior to 1986 we focused on changing the look of our stores and the structure of the company." K Mart he said committed billion of dollars for store remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system upgraded its merchandise mix acquired three large specialty retailers divested underperforming businesses and restructured its long-term debt. "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment community. However beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985 our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct for the long term " the K Mart chairman said. Reuter

4232,TRAIN,true,false,PHILLIPS &lt;P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT,Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt C.J. "Pete" Silas chairman told Reuters in an interview. "Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets already installed " he said but he declined to estimate annual cash flow for 1987. Analysts estimate Phillips" cash flow at over one billion dlrs for 1987 while long term debt which resulted from restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985 hovers about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986. Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas properties. "We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash flow prospects " he said. He projected a capital expenditure budget of 730 mln dlrs up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln dlrs. Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and production and most of that will be spend overseas Silas said. "Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings " Silas said. Phillips estimates that the project which is expected to cost 1.5 billion dlrs will increase recovery by 170 mln gross barrels of oil over a period of 24 years. Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas said he was seeking "a modification of terms with the Chinese government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang fields) commercially viable." In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point Arguello Calif. field started up by the fourth quarter. "We expect to start up the first platform then " Silas said. But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the company to part with several oil and gas assets. Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K. North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in 1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is now completed Silas said. "We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good value for us but possibly so for someone else " Silas said. Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings for the company. "Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales while regrettable were necessary to reduce debt " Silas said. He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels for several months. "Then everyone would be looking at sales (of assets) and we're no different from the others " Silas said. In other areas Silas looks for improved earnings from Phillips chemical operations which provided 299 mln dlrs in earnings for 1986 up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985. "This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and demand balance for products low feedstocks and energy costs for our operations " Silas said "In 1987 we think the market's supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock and energy costs will rise due to price recovery."

4266,TRAIN,true,false,BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS,British Telecommunications Plc's &lt;BTY.L> profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said. Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years. He said &lt;Mercury Communications Ltd> a Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> subsidiary was becoming a significant competitor. Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom's most profitable areas. One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct. The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike which lead to some disruption in service could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system Odgers said. However he forecast that the last quarter's results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout. He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities. But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future. British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing he said adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover. Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon down 4p from yesterday's close and off an early high of 248p. Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said the market expects slower profit growth but forecast a seven to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion. Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising prices was limited as long as inflation remains low. Reuter

The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the Pittsburgh-based maker of carbon tool and specialty steel products. Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd and other investors. Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding. For the tender price to be raised Cyclops must provide Cyacq with all non-public information provided to Dixons Group and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in offering material by Dixons based on the information Cyacq said. Additionally Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common and its rights to fees or expenses if the Dixon-Cyclop merger agreement is broken must be rescinded Cyacq said. Cyacq said financial projections it developed for Cyclops were materially lower than the financial projections provided by Cyclops to Dixons Group. A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no details of the new Cyacq proposal and could not comment. "We have nothing in hand " she said. In addition to making specialty metal products Cyclops also operates about 115 specialty stores that sell consumer electronics products. The stores are located in 17 states concentrated in the Northeast Northwest and Southwest. Cyclops employs about 8 900 people in Pennsylvania Ohio and other states. It also has interests in non-residential construction. In 1986 Cyclops earned 21.3 mln dlrs or 5.26 dlrs a share on sales of 1.5 billion dlrs compared to 1985 earnings of 26.2 mln dlrs or 6.20 dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion the spokeswoman said. The agreement with Dixons Group calls for Cyclops's steel and construction businesses to be sold to a unit of Alleghany Corp &lt;Y> for about 110 mln dlrs once the merger is completed. A Cyacq spokesman said the new conditional tender price would be all cash. He had no comment on whether Cyacq plans to withdraw its current offer which is scheduled to expire midnight on March six. Dixon Group's offer extends to March 17. Reuter

The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery's products. A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction. There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York. The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160 000 barrels per day the Union Pacific spokesman said and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction. The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector. Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition. One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence. The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's &lt;SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary. In that agreement signed September 15 1986 PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock. The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply trade sources said.

The director Doresy Gardner resigned in a March 10 letter to the Purolator board which was included in a filing made by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in which the company would bought out by a group of its managers and E.F.

4477,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP &lt;PCC>,Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would find a new suitor for the company traders said. Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share 265 mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of its Purolator courier division's management. The stock today hit 36-1/4 up one. Today Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10. The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier division. "Basically (the courier division) is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs " said Gardner in a telephone interview with Reuters. Gardner is an official of Kelso Management a firm associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity companies owns eight pct of Purolator and Gardner said he personally owns 20 000 shares. A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from Gardner. Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the transaction with Hutton LBO was announced analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor. While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again. "There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question of management's willingness to let the process continue " said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction. Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S. courier operations. The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant majority equity interest in Purolator. "As far as I can tell from the public documents from the deal that's on the table Hutton is basically putting up zero. One always likes a situation like that. You always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher " said one arbitrager. The firm however is supplying temporary financing and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position. While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction the sources said there is some risk to the firm. "There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash and all sorts of things that make it very speculative " said one of the sources adding there are also severance payments to employees. The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so-called "bridge" financing for the transaction. The bridge financing is a temporary loan from Hutton. The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing expected to come from banks. However it may take some time to replace the financing the source said resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm. Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale. "It's a very complex transaction but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place " Gardner said. Reuter

Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs while the Reichmanns' &lt;Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of &lt;Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>. "We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope there won't be any change but there could be " Holden-Brown told reporters after a speech in Toronto. He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons and Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct. "Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion for either the put or call to be exercised " Holden-Brown said. In answer to a reporter's question Holden-Brown said it would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49 pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. "I don't think we would have any objection to it " he added. Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's board of directors and has total responsibility for its management. "We cannot contemplate giving up our control " he said. Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial results but he said "it will be substantial." "I am not able to give profit forecasts " he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings and has no current plans for a stock issue. He said the company is not currently negotiating any more acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating possible purchases of wines spirits soft drinks or food concerns. "I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery scene (which is) highly concentrated already " he added.

Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60 and yesterday's close of 14.50 on the issue announcement. The issue will be underwritten by &lt;Morgan Grenfell Australia Ltd> and &lt;McCaughan Dyson Ltd> apart from the shares to be taken up by Adsteam's associate and largest shareholder department store retailer &lt;David Jones Ltd>. New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will rank equally thereafter. Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both issues from 99.36 mln. Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally performed well and its results as the ultimate holding company and beneficiary reflected this solid performance.

4665,TRAIN,false,true,JAPAN REJECTS U.S. OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE,A Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm. "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues " Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American Division told Reuters. U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> U.S. Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale. U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB> does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division. In addition Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law saying "the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market." Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field. "The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied and this is a bullying ploy " Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said. However the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. "The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley " said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co. U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market. A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact. "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem " he told Reuters. Despite the furore Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters. REUTER

He described the application as a precautionary move and said no agreement on buying a majority stake had yet been reached.

4691,TRAIN,true,false,SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS,Sandoz AG &lt;SANZ.Z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to double figures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November's warehouse fire a senior company official said. The official who declined to be identified told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the "one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident. However the official said the final figure would be "much less than that cited in earlier comments." He gave no further details. In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy &lt;CIGZ.Z> which reported last month Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar the official said. Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs the Sandoz official said. Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs. The third major Swiss chemical company F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Co &lt;HOFZ.Z> has not yet reported its results. REUTER
4692,TRAIN,true,false,ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987,Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986 chief executive Hans Jucker said. "The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future " he said. "We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes however that our industrial environment does not worsen." He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining after provisions from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses plus those carried forward from 1985 had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition to reassure other creditors Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z> Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse &lt;CRSZ.Z> to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion and similar alternations were made for previous years. After 1986 losses shareholder's equity stood at only 895 mln francs. REUTER

The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries supported by an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate according to a ministry survey. Total sales of the 15 308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll fell one pct to 217 217 billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter. Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2 394 billion yen against a 22.1 pct fall in the preceding quarter the ministry said. Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell 3.9 pct to 8 004 billion yen compared with a 1.4 percent fall the previoius quarter.

5172,TRAIN,true,false,CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS  HELPED BY AX,Automobiles Citroen expects rising sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits significantly this year continuing a financial recovery after six straight years of losses president Jacques Calvet said. Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX sports model he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we have been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement in 1987 compared with 1986 " he added. Citroen part of the private Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.PA> group increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after 11.7 pct in 1986. The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the European market excluding France to 3.2 pct this year from 2.9 pct in 1986. "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the demand " Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us." Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut the deficit to 400 mln in 1985 helped by moves to modernise its range and improve productivity. Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986 profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs. This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic." Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX launched on the French market last October. It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months. The car has registered just over 20 000 sales. It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous- Bois in northern Paris as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain with production just reaching target level of 1 000 cars a day. The car which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long-running 2CV and the Visa is designed to compete with the Renault 5 Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa. The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent of the national market." REUTER

5345,TRAIN,true,false,H AND R BLOCK &lt;HRB> SEES GAINS FROM TAX REFORM,With the April 15 tax return deadline less than a month away confused taxpayers will be converging on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes. Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a "bonanza " analysts say. "For the short term the key word is confusion Block Vice President Tom Bloch said in an interview. "When Congress drastically changes laws confusion results and tax preparers benefit " Bloch said. "Next year when taxpayers take the new forms and place them side by side to compare them more people will throw their hands up and say 'I'm going to get help '" he said. "Tax forms will look very different next year " he added. Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987 earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs. "Next year Block could have a bonanza " Buchbinder said. Based on estimates of a larger work force Block could show a gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared he said. In the 1986 tax season Block prepared 9 215 300 U.S. tax returns up 1.5 pct over the previous year. The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax season up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms according to the IRS. For the longer term while confusion will continue to bring clients into Block's 8 866 tax preparation offices worldwide there are some changes in the act that will have a negative effect Bloch conceded. Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax return and in some cases simplify the form he noted. In addition some low income wage earners will be taken off the tax rolls he said. Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to offset some of the negatives. Last tax season the average cost for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73 dlrs worldwide Bloch said. This tax season rates will be up about three or four pct in line with the inflation rate he said. Block expects "some expansion" this tax season of its electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made available for the direct filing by the IRS Bloch noted. The IRS estimates about 90 000 returns will be directly filed this tax season up from the 26 000 returns injected in the 1986 tax season. First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988. Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for television ads. "They may get a little more bang for their buck " he said. He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its balance sheet sheet and says if interest rates rise it could be of great benefit to them. Reuter

It said this assumes full use of the remaining 1 250 000 dlrs available under a line of credit from Celanese Corp which requires approval of Celanese Corp &lt;CZ>.

5473,TRAIN,true,false,ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION,&lt;Royal Trustco Ltd> in a move unique among Canadian trust companies is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct president Michael Cornelissen said. First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because ... they're going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies " Walsh said. Global operations which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview. He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990. Royal Trust Canada's second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank. Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s when other Canadian trusts the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans were focusing on domestic retail banking. The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations which attained full British banking powers in 1980 Cornelissen said. Last year Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp which included asset management merchant and private banking companies. "It was a heaven-sent opportunity " Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up." Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management private banking and advisory services. He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations "before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage acquired in the Dow Financial deal. "The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business " he said adding that in trust-type services "we don't think the international markets are well-served." Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad Cornelissen said. Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital said Cornelissen whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs more than any other Canadian trust. Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000 Asia will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of global productive capacity Cornelissen said "We knew we had to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the "immediate future " although "we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities." Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S. which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks. "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S. " said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years." He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust. Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks trusts insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust "but not drastically more " Cornelissen said.

The outlook for 1987 remains at 2.50 dlrs to three dlrs. Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4. "Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through 1988 and 1989 " he said. Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors - higher prices improved market share reduced costs and improved demand. The higher prices will stick because its Japanese competitor Komatsu has had to raise prices because of the increased value of the yen he said. Reuter

5643,TRAIN,false,true,SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> ENDS PACT TO SELL FAIRCHILD,Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its Fairchild Semiconductor operations. The company said the rising political controversy in the U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable time. The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. Defense Department in part on national security grounds. The company said termination of the agreement opened other possibilities including a possible leveraged buyout of the semiconductor maker by Fairchild management. In the interim Fairchild would continue its ongoing business within Schlumberger the oilfield services concern said. Last October Schlumberger announced the sale of the Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year. Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale but industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about 200 mln dlrs. The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department. Additionally Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations about the transaction since it was announced. Government officials have expressed concern that the sale could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting key advanced technology into Japanese hands. New high-technology semiconductors are used in supercomputers which are faster and more powerful than existing computers.

5690,TRAIN,false,true,SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER,Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit Wall Street analysts said. "I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with Fujitsu Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in the works " said Paul Johnson a semiconductor analyst with L.F. Rothschild. "There are unquestionably other buyers out there " added Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. "A lot of companies have looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it." Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD> Sunnyvale Calif. and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI> Milpitas Calif. industry analysts said. Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM> Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also seek to buy Fairchild but could possibly run into antitrust problems the analysts added. Moreover Fairchild's management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino Calif. company analysts said. In a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with Fujitsu Schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities including a possible buyout by Fairchild management. The company said it ended the deal in which Fujitsu would have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time. Analysts questioned this explanation however arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned companies. "Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the U.S. government didn't want it " said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company's news release. He said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit. Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately available for comment. Analysts noted the significance of the government's apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of Fairchild. Administration officials including Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems. "The government really stood up for the semiconductor industry " said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. "That I think is the real significance of this." Consequently analysts said the Japanese government might now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade agreement signed last summer.

5710,TRAIN,false,true,ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION,Corporate raider Carl Icahn acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible violations of securities laws. Icahn who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group. The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12 1986 Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons including Icahn violated securities laws and related rules Icahn said. Specifically the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC which is obviously already aware of its own probe Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company's stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal according to published reports. Making late filings of 13D forms which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to "warehouse" shares of stock. In a warehousing scheme a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them. By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert. Last year the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc. Reuter

In 1986 SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.

SmithKline whose major product is the antiulcer medication Tagamet said in the report that it intends to improve earnings from existing products expand its product portfolio and optimize its financial resources. To bolster its position in the antiulcer market in which Tagamet has met stiff competition SmithKline said its strategy to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered by two joint ventures one with &lt;Wellcome PLC> and one pending venture in Japan. SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct annually. "Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility " Gavin Herbert president of the eye and skin care product group said in the report. In 1986 Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln dlrs. It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories pharmaceuticals unit with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs will file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a number of cardiovascular agents including tissue plasminogen activator over the next two years. It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct larger in 1987 with more than 1 000 sales personnel. Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing unit with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs performs 24 mln tests a year and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in testing for the AIDS antibody. Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the cost of money it may buy back more shares. In the last three years it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares. SmithKline begins the year with a new management team including its new chief operating officer George Ebright. Reuter

Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign debt because the Brazilian economy is essentially healthy.

TransAmerica a privately held company that has been in bankruptcy since 1983 said its suit alleges that Coastal and its chairman Oscar S. Wyatt Jr unlawfully interfered with agreements it previously reached with its creditors causing the company significant damage. TransAmerica also said its suit filed in state district court in Harris County Texas seeks injunctions against Wyatt and Coastal to enjoin them from interfering with its contractual agreements with its creditors. The company alleged that beginning in mid-1986 Coastal and its chairman took various steps to acquire its gas and other assets. Coastal has used TransAmerica's bankruptcy proceedings to engineer a hostile takeover attempt the company charged. In its suit TransAmerican alleged that Coastal and Wyatt are "notorious corporate raiders who have been restrained in the past from taking over other corporations in their attempt to create a stranglehold position from which they could control and raise gas prices..." "It is obvious that Coastal's efforts to improperly take over TransAmerican is a thinly veiled attempt to control a larger share of the Texas gas market to the detriment of end users and consumers " the company alleged.

5787,TRAIN,true,false,CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET,Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's &lt;CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs stock analysts said. Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company. Cathay 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK> made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year. Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend making a total of 19 cents for the year as forecast in the prospectus analysts polled by Reuters said. They said the airline's performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs. The weakness of the local currency pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar and low fuel prices moved further in the company's favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation James Capel (Far East) Ltd said. James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs. Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative. "This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased " said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels but profits rose 69 pct. The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company's fuel oil bill last year as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months analysts said. By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985 the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct. "Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct " said James Capel. "This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct." A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits James Capel said. A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay's revenue increase but the company's load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services. James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct though the airline's load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct. "Cathay added new planes and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air " said Tsang. "This affected its load factor." Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier &lt;Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's decision to resume service to New Zealand last year analysts said. REUTER

5808,TRAIN,false,true,FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY,Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB.N> decision to end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> to buy 80 pct of its &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale will make Japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High technology firms but will not halt such attempts industry analysts said. The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by the Japanese firm said analysts polled by Reuters. "The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's North American operations but it would have been a great boost " James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said. French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time. The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and Defence Department partly on national security grounds. Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North American sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology an area where Fujitsu is weak analysts said. The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional microchip production facilities worldwide eight of them in the U.S. A report by the Capel firm said. "It was an entry point a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things " said Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst Rick May. Several analysts said the purchase would not have given Fujitsu access to critical defence technology. "(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a thing of the past " May said. The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise Fairchild's production lines Capel's Murtha said. The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High tech firms but they are unlikely to stop analysts said. Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the U.S. Although some said it could use the estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm. "It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in America remains " said Capel's Murtha. "The Japanese will continue to shop for bargains but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable." Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the Fairchild sale analysts said. "They're not going to slow up they're just going to buy smaller pieces ... Because of the political risk " said Barclays de Zoete's May. Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super minicomputer makers he said. Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie-ups some analysts said. "This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either " said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. "The pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move -- why should the government step in to prevent it?" Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S. Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate. "This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments' comment " Tamura said. "I think it was improper for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they did " he said. A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

Marc Mathieu of &lt;Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications> SAT told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct for APT the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT &lt;T.N.> and the NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS>. The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made up of SAT APT Cie du Midi &lt;MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds. Under French law foreign investors are restricted to a 20 pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings. The make-up of the holding company however is subject to close discussions within the government due to legal queries over the nationality of the mutual funds a Finance Ministry official said. Although bought by French citizens they are managed by foreign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and &lt;Banque de Neuflize Schlumberger Mallet SA> controlled by Algemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS> an SAT spokesman said. CGCT which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone switching market is to be sold by the government for 500 mln francs by private tender. Five groups are bidding for the company and the government has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April. APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT but declined to give details or say how an increase would affect foreign stakes in CGCT. In 1985 CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs. A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to French standards. The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction of the French government privatisation laws which reopened bidding among a wider range of applicants. Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany's Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> allied with Schneider SA &lt;SCHN.PA> subsidiary Jeumont-Schneider Sweden's Telefon AB LM Ericsson &lt;ERIC.ST> allied with Matra &lt;MATR.PA> and Bouygues SA &lt;BOUY.PA> Italy's &lt;Italtel> and Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd &lt;NTL.TO>.

6157,TRAIN,false,true,TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL,Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company. However several arbitragers said they would shy away from the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how high bidding for the company would go and whether the company would agree to a takeover. "There are too many uncertainties " said one arbitrager. Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4. Dudley Taft Taft vice chairman and Narragansett Capital Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board stating they were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150 dlrs per share. The company responded that the proposal would be submitted to the board of directors but that no decisions have yet been made on a sale of the company. "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per share) " said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current levels unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the broadcast properites. Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman Sachs and Co its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives such as restructuring. Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by Robert Bass and Carl Lindner chairman of American Financial Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds 16.2 pct. The Taft family which founded the company almost 50 years ago has about 12 pct. Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft. "I could see if things got really crazy that it might go for 175 (dlrs per share) " said one arbitrager but he speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more than a price in the 160s. Another speculated that Lindner might bid but he speculated the investor would not really be interested in running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment. Dennis McAlpine an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co said he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged buyout. "Ideally you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all the interests involved " he said adding the two largest shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft. He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the company has been about 140 dlrs per share but that the highest estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the broadcast industry. Reuter

Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share this year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988. Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of 729 500 shares. Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and the Boddington gold project both located in Australia. An analyst familiar with the two mines said "the properties together have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share for Reynolds." The analyst who asked not to be identified said the rise in the stock today was likely the result of "U.S. investors that were not completely cognizant of the size or the importance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia." Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine. Boddington is principally a bauxite mine. The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington. Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings estimates expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988. Last year Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs a share which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of new accounting rules 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards and other extraordinary items.

6225,TRAIN,false,true,PERU TO SELL 40 STATE FIRMS TO CUT BUDGET DEFICIT,peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among government-owned companies. Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially according to jose palomino president of the government's state company holding firm the national development council (conade). He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies. Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987 against the govenment target of 40-50 pct. Palomino said aeroperu the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits. Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange. Last november palomino said conade's plans included the possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold in a copper mine empresa nacional tintaya sa in the southern state of arequipa. Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager enrique estremadoyro were available for comment on whether foreigners would be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries said they were out of their offices.

"I think there's a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs " the paper quoted the official as saying. "Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and computer companies " said the official who the newspaper said was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> takeover bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>. The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday and industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition in the important computer chip manufacturing industry. Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for vital technology. The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas. "Everybody wants an open investment policy but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest " Baldrige was quoted as saying. The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency policymaking group such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security Council.

He told reporters the government organisation had expressed interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to invest 800 mln pesos assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a share. The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and sequestered by the government. The block is split between class A and class B stock. SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N. Soriano Corp the family company of San Miguel president Andres Soriano del Rosario said. The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices. Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to unidentified foreign purchasers. He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares. President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the shares. Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on Good Government. The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco the former chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

6346,TRAIN,false,true,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS,More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters. Already rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks steel and other businesses. In the latest attempt Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers. Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd &lt;DSEC.T> Japan's two largest brokerage firms are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking the takeover specialists said. Major trading houses which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists. Among manufacturers car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore. "The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses especially in the U.S. -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal " a takeover specialist at one trading company said. Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months. But the yen's strength which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets has frozen Japanese corporate growth the specialists said. Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports. Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates now at record lows offer little investment opportunity. "Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous but the recent economic factors have become a driving force " said a banking industry source. So far though the Japanese are being cautious. While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen one merchant banker said. Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now but that time span appeared now to be too long. Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now he said. A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S. Last year which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile he added. Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses. Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese the trading company official says. "Japanese people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals." But now after some experience overseas Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice he adds. "This is a healthy progression." However the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns. "Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation " one banker said. "They will expand their operations only gradually a typical way for Japanese business." A foreign merchant banker also noted "There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done." But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies the specialists said. Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. "Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend " one takeover specialist said. Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed activity could build the specialists said. But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already they said Japanese trading houses long-term credit and commercial banks brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31 as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end. Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen down five pct from a year earlier he said. The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31 down 59.2 pct from a year earlier on sales of 343.06 billion down 6.3 pct. The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad. The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen Hashimoto said. Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300 000 units in the three months unchanged from a year earlier while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300 000 from 350 000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450 000 from 300 000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950 000 from one mln due to lower exports to China. Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986 Hashimoto said. Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier. Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct. Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen down 33 pct from a year earlier on sales of 400 billion down 12 pct. Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987 he added.

GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at 90.50 dlrs a share up two dlrs on the day. In a newspaper advertisement General Partners said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended. General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at least 51 pct voting power again fully diluted. It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp shares. General Partners said it would set up voting trust arrangements pending review of its long-form application for FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's broadcasting subsidiary. The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to provide for an increase in authorized common shares a classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative voting. The latter two changes would make it harder for minority shareholders to elect directors. General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer. GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding making the value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs. Last fall AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire &lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Lear Siegler eventually went private for 1.66 billion dlrs. GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace as well as broadcasting. The company faces challenges to its two television and 12 radio station licenses partly becuase it failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign payments and political contributions. GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.

The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only one private company should enter the market.

Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake. He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged consortium at less than three pct and added that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct . Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house &lt;C. Itoh and Co.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. &lt;MER.N> jointly hold 13 pct .

Gencorp which has interests in tire- and plastic-making aerospace and broadcasting has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding. The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of financing a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions. In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A. William Reynolds describing the offer General Partners said it was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to meet as soon as possible. In a statement General Partners said it has contributed 250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc a unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>. A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He said he was not sure the company had formally received notice of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts. He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or whether it would issue a statement later today. In the letter General Partners said it plans to maintain Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron and retain the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General broadcasting subsidiary which has been involved in disputes over license renewals at several of its television stations. Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations WOR in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles. General Partners officials were not immediately available. Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders and the NYSE said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2 a new 52-week high. The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in equity from General Partners the 1.25 billion dlr loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers a senior subordinated bridge loan for which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours after a request from the partnership and the one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest the partnership said.

6471,TRAIN,true,false,MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS,&lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its 1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> shares and because of securities trading losses in the U.S. Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some eight mln stg to 82.2 mln. He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made but Catto would not elaborate. Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year. The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid. Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair. Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive Geoffrey Collier resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges. Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of the most traumatic in our history " but that clients and staff had been supportive. "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet." Profits for the year up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management. Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonable touch of the budget." Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months. He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562 000 stg in compensation following their resignations but declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig he said. Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p 9p down on yesterday's 375p. REUTER...

Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc. "Following announcement of the merger agreement the company was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a proceeding against the company " Allegheny said. "The company is cooperating in the commission's investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking of testimony of employes and others " Allegheny said. In the ongoing probe Allegheny said the staff has asked for information about company executive compensation and benefit plans certain company-owned real estate travel and entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft. It also has asked for information on acquisitions and divestitures the company's accounting system "and other internal controls " Allegheny said. The probe began in February 1986 Allegheny said. The SEC as a matter of policy routinely declines comment on its enforcement actions. The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company had violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy statements. The suits later consolidated into a single class-action complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court allege securities law violations involving numerous current and former Allegheny officers and directors. Earlier this month lawyers for the shareholders asked the court to expand the charges to include an allegation that in the buyout Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its public shareholders at an unfair price. Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself against all charges. The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley. In the buyout a group led by First Boston tendered March 13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share. Reuter

Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986 but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59 800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987. Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363 000. Of the total exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210 000 but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154 000 from 137 180 in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987 helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57 000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400 000 from 384 000 in 1986 when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392 000. Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees. At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record 39 800 a rise of 3 400 over 1985. REUTER

6581,TRAIN,true,false,CONT'L ILLINOIS &lt;CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM,The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp the company's annual report says. One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past be restored to current earnings status it said. As a result those amounts will be subject to federal taxes it said. No amounts were disclosed. Continental said it decided to deal with this change "in its entirety" in 1987. Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation rules and although the impact will not be material in the short term the Act will require for the first time that income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable the report said. The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by 17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years it said. Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8 mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in 1987 and if not used in 1987 to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988 it said. Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental takes place the report said. This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next two years to cause a change in ownership it noted. In December the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in the form of common stock. Reuter

6639,TRAIN,false,true,U.S. HOUSE PLAN SEEKS TO BAR FOREIGN TAKEOVERS,A House subcommittee voted to give President Reagan authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies similar to the takeover of Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB> Fairchild Semiconductor Corp by Fujitsu Ltd which was withdrawn. The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce approved as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a provision giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign companies if the sale was not in the national or economic interest. The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall trade bill which is being written by several House committees. The subcommittee's bill would bar imports of digital audio recording equipment that is not made with anti-copying chips. This provision is designed to protect U.S. companies from the unauthorized use of U.S. designs in foreign products. The bill calls for an investigation of whether U.S. engineering and construction firms are given adequate opportunity to bid on Japan's civil works procurement practices including the construction of the Kansai airport. The Energy and Commerce subcommitte rejected a plan offered by Rep. William Dannemeyer a California Republican to require the U.S. to pay investors one pct for the right to hold their gold investments in government storage. His amendment called for the government to sell gold coins and gold-backed bonds with maturities of 30 to 50 years to investors to reduce the federal debt. Reuter

6665,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/GENCORP INC &lt;GY>,The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company analysts said. Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp. However market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading. "The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's cooperation " said Larry Baker an analyst with E.F. Hutton group. Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations. Some of the disputes dating back about 20 years were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions. "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation " said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction. A source close to General Partners however said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations. The source said if approved the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out. If it received the "short-form" approval General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer such as General Partners might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell the stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station WHJ-TV. Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station's license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in Secaucus N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. Charles Rose an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co said that on a breakup valuation the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs as would DiversiTech the plastics unit. Broadcasting including assets pending sale might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share he said. The company formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share he said. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds who became chairman last year has been emphasizing the company's Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp founded in 1915 became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non-strategic assets of the company " Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer but they declined to predict what steps the company might take. They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock and there was some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock. "I would doubt they would greenmail them but nothing surprises me anymore " said Rose. GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained First Boston Corp and Kidder Peabody and Co as advisers.

Under terms of the transaction each Norstar shareholder will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously announced April one Fleet stock split. The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding. Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one 1988 the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's interstate banking law takes effect. For the full year ended december 31 Fleet a Rhode Island based bank holding company reported net income of 136.7 mln dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar an Albany N.y. holding company reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.

It is the intention of both companies that cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline for either company's stock holders the company said. For 1986 Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68 dlrs a share. In addition Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued shares of common stock that will constitute 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding.

6708,TRAIN,true,false,CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS,Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way. "I believe it will take three to six months maybe longer for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt " Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess " Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing William Ogden chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago Continental's largest subsidiary said in response to an inquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share. The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp FDIC during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government. The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26 1987 Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans. In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S. Concerning banking acquisitions Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks. Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks. He said however that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln. The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank. Swearingen who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor. The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo Swearingen said but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn't need external sources of cash.

He also said the transaction could be financed through a debt issue or conventional financing from investors. Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment proposals bought to them but he added "the investors must be willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not just selling off assets." Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.

6726,TRAIN,true,false,CAROLINA POWER &lt;CPL> CANCELS GENERATING UNIT,Carolina Power and Light Co said its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two the second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County N.C. The company said the 690 000 kilowatt unit was only about one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in 1992. Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under review because of a decision by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission that would have required the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing scrubbers. Carolina Power said Unit One which has been in operation since 1983 meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers through the use of low-sulphur coal and "The addition of scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal air quality improvements." The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost power from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peaking purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with scrubbers. It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later development of a generating unit. Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about 877 mln dlrs including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers. "The higher construction costs plus higher operating costs would increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year." A company spokesman said the company has already spent about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been made of the cost of canceling the plant but the company does not expect to take a charge against earnings. He said Carolina Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings it will make late this year or early next year. Reuter

The auditors also qualified the company's 1985 report for the same reason noting the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in early 1986.

6742,TRAIN,true,false,NE ELECTRIC SEES HIGHER CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS,New England Electric System &lt;NES> expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986 the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting. It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989. The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project. The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England the utility said. New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987. The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total. New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well. The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans. President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years. However the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth he said pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years. He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy. Huntington said New England Elecetric has "all but rejected new coal fired plants" to supply additional power. He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules. Later vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units. He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal. Reuter

Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2 billion dlrs including GSX Corp the U.S. waste services unit acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs Laidlaw president Michael de Groote told analysts. Last year Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs or 63 cts per share on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs. De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results" in the second quarter ended February 28 but would not be more specific. He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not include possible further acquisitions and said that the addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1990. De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The rest came from acquisitions he said. Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation a subsidiary of GSX within the next few weeks but this will not make any material contribution to earnings de Groote said. He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoing negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd a Toronto-based chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and U.S. operations from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary. De Groote said that regardless of the outcome of the proposed Tricil acquisition Laidlaw will decide within the next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical waste business through GSX Corp. "We feel it is a profitable business with good growth potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right management " de Groote said. Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S. subsidiary Laidlaw Transportation Inc with the proceeds of a 200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing. De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants. De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will represent about 49 pct of revenues school buses will contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct. The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing well and there are no plans to sell it he said. He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to earnings per share for the year. He also said that further acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely within the next few months. Reuter

6770,TRAIN,true,false,U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS,Problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for U.S. banks in a quarter century the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said. The nation's 14 181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8 billion dlrs in 1986 down slightly from 1985's record 18.1 billion dlrs. The total was still the second highest ever reported but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961. The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country the FDIC said. In the East one in 12 banks had losses last year while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses. Nationwide one out of five banks reported losses the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue. "I don't remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area " FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters. He said that while the figures were not good they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance. Some 44 banks have failed so far this year twice as many as failed by this time a year ago but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue. On a positive note banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest Seidman said. Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs a 23 pct rise from a year ago. Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22 the FDIC said. Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks. He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected. But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger Seidman said. Reuter

Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale. It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel castings and forgings which offset gains in the mining sector and improvements in forestry equipment. Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers' financing difficulties. Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade. However there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro-electric power generation the company said. The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U.S. and export markets mainly China and India. The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components. Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S. imports of Canadian lumber but there were encouraging signs at yearend the company said.

6815,TRAIN,false,true,GENCORP &lt;GY> GROUP TO SEEK ANTI-GREENMAIL VOTE,GAMCO Investors Inc an affiliate of Gabelli and Co plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision at the GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31 according to GAMCO Chairman Mario Gabelli. Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a premium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8 pct of its stock. Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates. The stock amounts to 1 462 000 shares and most of it was reported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive investors to show holdings of more than five pct. Earlier today General Partners owned by Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc launched a 100 dlr per share tender offer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and 20 dlrs per share too low. GenCorp has made no comment on the offer. Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider spinning off all assets other than the GenCorp broadcast properties to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges. "One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to the meeting and putting up "no greenmail " Gabelli said. Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation in the offer. The annual meeting is to be held in Akron Ohio. Reuter
6816,TRAIN,true,false,LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87,Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986 General Director Gerhard Wagner said. Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates. The bank Austria's third largest raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985. Announcing the 1986 results Wagner said: "We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987." Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985. Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total. Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank's London branch which opened in April 1985 but said that it came close to one mln stg. On schilling lending profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln. According to the 1987 federal budget the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state. Reuter

6844,TRAIN,false,true,AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY,Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year company officials and analysts said. State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd> approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations. "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time " McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented. The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin. "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over " he said. Gelco Corp of Minnesota decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters. The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end the company said. While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry handling more than 50 000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year. The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program adopted after another Canadian Company &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp> acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company. Last month Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. For Air Canada its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an "excellent financial investment" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said. The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp of Calgary an in-city messenger service. It did not disclose financial terms but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs. She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business. Gelco will continue to operate with current management independently of Air Canada although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation. "They're well run they're a good investment they're doing well in a growing market and that's the way we want to keep it " Szynkarsky said. Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada. "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue " Hine said. "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder and the more sausage you can stuff through the more money you make " he added. Reuter

6914,TRAIN,false,true,FLEET &lt;FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR,Fleet Financial Group hopes its proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR> ranked as the largest U.S. banking merger can be completed by the beginning of 1988 according to an executive of Fleet. Robert Lougee director of corporate communications for Rhode Island-based Fleet told Reuters the company is exploring the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1 1988 from July one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature. The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that said the deal worth about 1.3 billion dlrs would be consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate banking outside of New England come down. "If we can consummate the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned " Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other banking institution in the state. He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law which only permits interstate banking mergers within New England can be amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp. If the Connecticut law is not amended in time Lougee said an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase provisions. The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled up by the money center giants. Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet and Albany N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers. Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed merger as "a partnership of two companies." Both will continue to operate existing headquarters after the merger. Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2 up 1/8 giving the deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs. That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion &lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal announced about four weeks ago is worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs. Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion dlrs making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range. "It's a merger of equals " said analyst John Rooney of Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share while Fleet's book value was 28.02 dlrs. Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his 60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his retirement then Murray could assume the top post. Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986 on the basis of the merger terms announced today. He noted that Fleet has a "teriffic reputation" after having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an innovator in securitization of mortgages. The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S. Norstar operates in most of New York state but not in New York City. Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would be combined. The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a "lock-up" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding. Reuter

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer. General Partners which launched the surprise tender offer today said it already 2 180 608 shares of GenCorp or 9.4 pct of the total outstanding common stock. General Partners which estimated the total cost of the takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs also said it plans to continue GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio station licenses. It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs. But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's headquarter in Akron Ohio. General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and related products. But it left open that it might make other changes in GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger. Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender offer General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes. In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds which was included in the SEC filing General Partners officials said they were "confident of our ability to promptly obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer materials." "For this reason we do not forsee any obstacles to a prompt consummation of the transaction " General Partners said. Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer for GenCorp. Reuter

7001,TRAIN,true,false,FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS,Media group John Fairfax Ltd &lt;FFXA.S> said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the impact of changes in the Australian tax system. Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to 25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30 mln from 44.29 mln. Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits paid by employers and not the recipients the company said in a statement. Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings. It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors. Fairfax said its flagship dailies The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age boosted advertising volume as did the Australian Financial Review and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly. But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue it said. Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B" shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>. This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit. Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result well below predictions made this time last year suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. "Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin " he said. "Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines." Reuter

7102,TRAIN,true,false,DEUTSCHE BABCOCK SEES HIGHER 1986/87 PROFITS,Deutsche Babcock AG &lt;DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year ending September 9 although the earnings level is still unsatisfactory managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said. He told a news conference that business during the year had weakened somewhat but was still generally positive. Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26 billion marks 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period. However he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end- February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at 8.64 billion marks. Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks. Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks. Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the current business year with financial reserves in the first five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86. He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86 according to the DVFA method were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10. The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference shares. REUTER

The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is 24.5 mln dlrs compared with 7 900 000 for 1985. The estimated 1986 results are based on 3 207 000 shares outstanding compared to 2 566 000 shares outstanding for 1985. R. Steven Lutterbach chairman said net income for 1986 was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins at the company's Western Environmental subsidiary and to an increase in bad debt reserves. Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986. Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve financial and accounting controls primarily at Western which were not adequate at the time of acquisition. He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second and fourth quarters. Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will be restated though final net income for the year will remain in the estimated range.

7155,TRAIN,true,false,PILLSBURY &lt;PSY> HURT BY RESTAURANT OPERATIONS,Pillsbury Corp reporting lower earnings for the third quarter ended February 28 said a strong performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group declines. Excluding unusual items it said restaurants operating profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales rose four pct. It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher operating profit but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale which introduced a new menu. Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron Burger King's distribution arm and said increased investment spending on developing concepts - QuikWok Bay Street and Key West Grill - hurt results. It said Foods operating profit excluding unusual items rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads and baking products major contributors to improvement in the quarter. A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in profit improvement for the nine months Pillsbury said. Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and lower corporate expenses largely as a result of an early retirement program initiated a year ago. Earlier Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5 mln dlrs or 56 cts a share down from 55.4 mln dlrs or 63 cts a share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from 1.46 billion dlrs. Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the 1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by nine cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months. As a result of the act it said its effective income tax rate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5 percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months. Reuter

He told reporters following the release of the company's 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels. U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985. Earlier Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985 before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well. Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year. He added that the firmness of oil prices in March when they were normally weaker made him "a bit encouraged" about the prospects for future levels. Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel. Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April. End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously. However Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves. If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously. Gas reserves also eased to 3 568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3 660 billion.

It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German publication Aids Forschung. But it said the article was about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the condoms made by INKEY. The company also said it is changing its name to Eurocapital Corp shortly. Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a U.S.-based &lt;Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own the remaining shares of the company which was set up to distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made or are being developed by INKEY. The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for the distributorship. The first 500 000 dlr payment is due 30 days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file with the FDA to market the condom but expects the approval process to be a lengthy one. The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated to condoms. As far as it knows the ingredient has not been tested in a spermicide. Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand name "Carlton." The exclusive distribution contract for the products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year periods the company said. It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have not gone on sale in other European countries. It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from the FDA. The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little or no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through Solar Systems' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below its current 45 pct. Reuter

7366,TRAIN,true,false,TEXAS COMMERCE &lt;TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987,Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs. Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love in an interview with Reuters did not elaborate on how much the bank expected earnings to increase. "We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement over last because we are stronger " Love said referring to Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical. The merger which may be finalized as early as May 1 will lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15 basis points Love said. The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved interstate banking effective January 1. Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas' struggling economy the only major Texas banks able to report profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6 mln dlrs MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs InterFirst lost 326.5 mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT> which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital lost 402.0 mln dlrs. Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems but added that the bank's nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987. "I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us " he said. "The fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans." In 1986 about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43 pct. More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986 up from 840 mln dlrs the year before were in real estate. Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office buildings in Houston which has a current vacancy rate of about 30 pct will be a gradual process that could take up to four years he said. "I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a barrel " he said. Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout Texas offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business Love said. "We are resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position " he said. In January Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in Montgomery County adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member banks he said. One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced in December InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT> both headquartered in Dallas agreed to merge in a deal valued at 570 mln dlrs. The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and InterFirst giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas banking market has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion plans for the state's second-largest city Love said. "We think we can try to get a little part of their roost " he said. The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an edge in developing new consumer products he said. "We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products " he said referring to expansion of such existing products as credit cards and investment banking. Reuter

Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 2.7 times book value. Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider trading scandal closed out February at a market value of 1.8 times book value. American Express was trading today at 78-1/4 off 3/8. For the last several weeks the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson. Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets. "I think this in all honesty is a preliminary step " said Long. "What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson " Long said. "Normally investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation " he said of Nippon. Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm like other investment banks needs capital to expand globally. American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However that number is substantially lower than growth last year a company spokesman said. American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning. That statement however did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson. David Anthony a Smith Barney analyst said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first. "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with the money they have " he said. Joan Goodman an analyst with Pershing and Co also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public. In its statement the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon. American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital. American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy. Shearson follows Goldman Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion. Analysts speculated there will be more such matches. "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital growth " said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury who follows other U.S. brokerage companies. Hanbury said some Japanese companies flush with cash are interested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money. That's a nice marriage " he said.

He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing two of its subsidiary's ferry services and a 10.3 mln dlr provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and severance pay costs.

He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem the current heavy losses of Sayam and to avoid competition between the two state-owned institutions. The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's name. Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance Ministry took over and re-named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd. Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. At the end of 1985 the bank with 13.8 billion baht of assets was ranked 12th among Thailand's 16 local commercial banks. Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six to seven billion baht of loans extended by its previous private management and was taking legal action to collect another four to five billion baht of doubtful debts. Krung Thai is Thailand's third largest bank. REUTER

7605,TRAIN,false,true,SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS  SHARE DISCLOSURE,A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share. In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG> chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks' own self-regulating bodies such as the Swiss Admissions Board to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in. A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers. Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems. "We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people " he said. The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated he said. Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies worried about takeovers increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares. However both types of issue had a drawback he said. The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961 pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company's statutes. Excessive issue of participation certificates which do not carry voting rights would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament. "People buying for example more than five pct of a company's shares should be made to declare their purchase " he said. REUTER

Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the rest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans incurred for the retirement of high-interest long-term debt. Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments but it said the "payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company will need to cover our investment in Perry which translates into savings for our customers." The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs.

7733,TRAIN,false,true,ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS,Companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks but these should not constitute a "dominant" holding an Italian government committee ruled. The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria said its decision reflected the "need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non-financial concerns." It did not quantify what might constitute a "dominant" holding. The committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks. Under the ruling credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits. The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned. Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be excluded from the conditions. The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms. With regard to bank holdings in companies the Bank of Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a company or another bank of 25 pct or more owned directly or indirectly. Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest. The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two predefined limits. These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank. REUTER

7742,TRAIN,true,false,TALKING POINT/FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION &lt;FBT>,First City Bancorporation's sale of 54 mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly reduce its energy problems but the bank's losses are still virtually guaranteed to continue analysts said. The package of energy loans was sold at book value so First City did not to show a gain or loss said bank spokesman James Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more of the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans to raise cash. The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and to oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had already been classified as nonperforming or charged off as a loss but he could not identify how many were included in those categories. The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's Energy Growth Fund a limited partnership created last month with 90 mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties. First City the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn in oil prices lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986 and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other capital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperforming assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend up from 563.1 mln dlrs at the end of 1985 Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in the troubled bank unless government assistance is available. "Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a substantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of itself won't make the company look better to a potential buyer " said Ray Archibold a banking analyst with McCarthy Crisanti and Maffei Inc. "It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54 mln dlrs is a substantial amount " Archibold said "but the deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans." Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs about 14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or suppliers analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by its past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late 1970s and early 1980s. First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential came from its Energy Finance Co. an entity formed in 1982 to loan money to "more venturesome" oil borrowers that promised a higher potential return. The other half of the loans were from First City's lead bank in Houston. Chris Kotowski an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co. said the sale of the package of energy loans was the first encouraging news from First City in months. "It's not going to solve all of First City's problems but it's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them to sell additional loans " Kotowski said. "Prudential can fund these things more cheaply than First City and there's an incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as values are depressed" In a statement First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the bank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to total loans. "This move which we believe is the first transaction of its kind helps us further and we were able to make it without suffering a loss." Reuter

Cable and Wireless which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters. That plan put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market. Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia &lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC). Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger. A key U.S. Senate committee Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger he said. The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm. In an attempt to hammer out an agreement Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked. At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska to form part of its global network. "C and W wants to start right away on the project such as application and other procedures " said Watanabe who is also chairman of &lt;Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japanese side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left with the new firm after the merger. "These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we are not a colony or something " said Watanabe. Reuter

Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per share down one ct today on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Hudson's Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs but that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.

"You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons in the second half " Holden-Brown said following a presentation to Toronto securities analysts. Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year. Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the company Holden-Brown also said. But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey he said. "So with Australians you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end " Holden-Brown said. Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts Holden-Brown replied: "No I don't." "We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful but I think we would be very expensive " he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry. "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier they might have had more luck I think " Holden-Brown said.

7927,TRAIN,true,true,BALLY &lt;BLY> SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT,Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit analysts said. "In the longer-term horizon Bally wants to concentrate on its gaming businesses " said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. Last week Bally said it was considering the sale of another non-casino unit its Six Flags amusement park unit which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs. Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "the company currently has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club company but in the long term we'll wait and see how the offering goes." Once Bally's biggest revenue producer the health club unit had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2 mln dlrs 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs. Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit could be the first step to selling it. "It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit's debt increase its cash flow and operating income making it an attractive buy to a third party " Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said. On Monday Bally said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct or 5.8 mln shares of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share. About half the proceeds 40 mln dlrs will be used to reduce parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile takeover according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson. Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit a Bally spokesperson said. Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have remained strong but are skeptical about the industry's long range prospects. "The fitness club industry over the last 10 years has grown tremendously but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle " said Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes. In addition "the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry " said one analyst. There are about 6 500 fitness clubs in the U.S. excluding clubs run by not-for-profit organizations according to the Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry. Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit which is the nation's largest health club chain Peltier said "no one has the money to offer to buy it." "The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through acquisition and then standardization " said Wayne LaChapelle chief financial officer of Livingwell INc &lt;WELL> the nation's second largest fitness chain operator whih LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in acquisition opportunities but "could not afford an acquisition the size of Bally at this time."

One company being studied could possibly be acquired on a friendly basis he said. Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to repurchase up to three mln ICN common shares. Discussing the possibility of an acquisition Panic said the such a purchase is necessary because ICN's current marketing capability would not be sufficient to support distribution of the company's products given ICN's expectations for market growth worldwide. ICN's principal product is ribavirin also known as Virazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and described as a broad-based anti-viral. The company has said its possible applications include treatment of some types of hepatitis herpes influenza childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers. ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in recent months because of Virazole which has undergone clinical trials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases. Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard to AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its review of data submitted by the company. He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a House Subcommittee is continuing. The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are conducting separate investigations to determine whether or not ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.

8085,TRAIN,false,true,AUSTRALIAN OFFER FOR SAN MIGUEL SHARES,Diversified investment company &lt;Ariadne Australia Ltd> has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm &lt;San Miguel> a Manila newspaper reported. The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman New Zealander Bruce Judge that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government. The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report. The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos. The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares. Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners. The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week. "Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines' yearly budget " Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday. "Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company's assets can be fully utilised." San Miguel the country's largest brewer is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines. Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap food and liquor distribution lines in Australia Britain the U.S. New Zealand and Hong Kong through &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd> a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.

The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd> a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns a 30 pct stake is planning a branch in the Philippines. He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares. Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines. He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut Planters Bank which is believed to be linked with the country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only offer in cash the newspaper reported. Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours that &lt;Neptunia Corp> a Hong Kong registered company which controlled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano is the other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares. The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel shares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo Cojuangco who is also chairman of United Coconut. Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm adding San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties. The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman New Zealander Bruce Judge that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government.

Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism. The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55 billion lire from 48 billion in 1985. A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in traffic with the U.S. In 1987. It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to New York to 19 per week to reinstate flights to Boston and to re-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service. The spokesman announced that from March 29 Alitalia would be starting a new weekly service to Shanghai.

8096,TRAIN,true,false,RAFIDAIN BANK'S JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL,The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country. Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986. Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars. Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation banking sources said. Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash. Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain's case allowing it longer to comply. They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties. The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550 332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars. REUTER

TMOC held interests outside the Cooper Basin region of South Australia and Queensland and the acquisition would further the Santos objective of developing as a broadly based oil and gas company with interests outside its existing base in the Cooper Basin the company said in a statement. Santos said TMOC holds several important domestic oil and gas production exploration and pipeline interests. In the Northern Territory it has a 43.75 pct stake in and operates the Mereenie oil and gas field in the Amadeus Basin and owns 32 pct of &lt;N.T.

8115,TRAIN,false,true,DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID,&lt;Dart Group Corp> said it told Supermarkets General Corp &lt;SGL> it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company. Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20 Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees. "We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms " said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL's approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers' severance agreements although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also Dart said Lieberman Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company's compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management's supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company's present policy. Dart said despite such management payments it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive. REUTER

For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658 000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs raising capital to 703 mln francs. The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France Vernes said. Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark. Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs Vernes said. If this bid fails Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants either in the maize or wheat starch sector. Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary another major reason for its capital increase. Kaysersberg which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords Vernes said.

Previously it had sought all shares. In a newspaper advertisement USAir said the offer and withdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire April 3 along with the new proration period. On Friday the U.S. Department of Transportation approved USAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were to acquire more than 51 pct in the tender it would be required to sell the excess within one week. USAir said receipt of the 9 309 394 shares -- which is also the minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of about 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1 pct on a fully diluted basis. The company said even if the purchase of the 9 309 394 Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit USAir would waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation Department approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir's application to gain control of Piedmont subject to the order not being rescinded or modified in an adverse way.

American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award made to Emerson Electric Co &lt;EMR> in February amounted to 60 mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged the award.

The company said its level of shipments is good despite a conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry wide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down slightly from a year ago it said. Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and time large shipments for the second half it said.

He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks especially those associated with foreign nations had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986. Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln. Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct. Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986. Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks. The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit which excludes earnings from trading on its own account had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks. The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985 Hackl said. It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business. The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45. Hackl said that in January and February this year the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

Sosnoff also said he has held preliminary talks with Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT> and Southmark Corp &lt;SM> on forming a joint venture to enter into talks to acquire Caesars in a friendly transaction in which Sosnoff would have a 50 pct interest and Pratt and Southmark the remainder. Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are not being actively pursued at the presentand may or may not be continued in the future. He said there could be no assurance that a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars would agreed to talks. "Several preliminary contacts with representatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indication that it wishes to enter into such negotiations " Sosnoff said. He said based on talks with staff members of gaming authorities there can be no assurance that the necessary regulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completed by the original April Three expiration date. Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15. The bid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangement of financing.

8441,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL &lt;WEN>,Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's International Inc's stock even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor. Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8 and lost a point when Coca Cola &lt;KO> said the rumors were untrue. However Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more than three mln shares. Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible. Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds. Yet a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill. Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc &lt;BUD> and Pepsico Inc &lt;PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither of those companies would comment nor would the Wendy's official. "It doesn't happen every day every week every month but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies " said Denny Lynch Wendy's vice president of communications. However Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors. Even before Coke denied the rumors analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them. "I can't put another name on it " said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy's stock. "It very well could be someone's interested." But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time for Wendy's to be sold. "They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an offer) but I can't believe this is the right price at the right time " Freedman said. "If a transaction takes place the buyer's going to control the situation " Freedman said. "I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't think it's worth much more than where it is " said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney. Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the "burger wars" between itself McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD> and Pillsbury Co's &lt;PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U.S. lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year analysts said. Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced breakfast which it has since withdrawn analysts said. Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround. There are analysts however who believe Wendy's may be vulnerable to a takeover. James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3 500. "They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants " Murren said. Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year Wendy's real sales store for store turned upwards in the fourth quarter. "That was about the first time in seven quarters " he said. Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy's. "My gut feeling is something's going to happen. I don't know what " she said. She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share. One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi. Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi which holds a contract with the company analysts said. Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants. Reuter

The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up 5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.

"Cyacq's main equity investor appears ready to pull out and deal directly with us for merely part of the company" said Dixons. "It raises questions as to the strength of their consortium and the purpose of their offer." Dixons also said a U.S. Federal Court had refused a request by counsel for Cyacq Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA> and a shareholder plaintiff to prevent Dixons from completing its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the court refused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidential information previously provided to Dixons. On Friday Cyacq Corp an investor group led by Audio/Video Affiliates and Citicorp raised their offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs per share from 80 dlrs per share if certain conditions were satisfied. Last week Dixons said it won out over rival bidders for Cyclops after getting 54 pct of Cyclop's oustanding with a 90.25 dlr or 384 mln dlr tender offer that expired March 18. On Friday Dixons agreed to reopen its tender offer until March 25 Wednesday. Dixons today called Cyacq's higher 92.50 dlr a share offer for Cyclops "highly conditional." Reuter

8506,TRAIN,true,false,IBM &lt;IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST,International Business Machines Corp hit by a two-year earnings slump should begin a come-back by the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988 analyst Rick Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said. "There will be increasing momentum in earnings albeit not until later this year " Martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm. Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid-range area rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending. IBM whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in mid-January has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at 149-1/2 dlrs. Analysts computer industry executives and the company itself have highlighted the external economic factors hampering IBM's growth. But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies and pointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view. "By replacing the product line earnings have soared " he said of DEC's line of VAX computers. In contrast to DEC IBM faultered with an incompatible mid-range product line. A new computer code-named "Fort Knox" was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range systems but the product never got off the ground he said. Instead aspects of the computer were integrated into the IBM 9370 machine introduced last year and other aspects should be unwrapped by 1988 Martin said. "The major story will be a rebound in its mid-range business." He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13 pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988. High-end computers primarily the Sierra line are coming to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5 pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year growth will drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988 he said. By 1988 overall revenue growth should rise to about 16 pct against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986 Martin said. Last year IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of 51.3 billion dlrs. Investors asked what this all meant to DEC whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid-range area. In response Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to DEC nor DEC as a threat to IBM because both companies were catering largely to existing customer bases rather than stealing market share from one another.

He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving electronic features is being readied for test marketing this summer and if successful could "materially benefit" operations. Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a health club facility adjoining a bowling center he said. Turning to its defense operations Reichert said he expects the division to receive significant contracts in the near future.

David M. Holland president of US Sprint's Dallas-based Southwest Division told Reuters in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost "about 500 mln dlrs." He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs over "two plus years" to set up its network. Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order to lease its lines. He said 16 000 miles of its 23 000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now "in the ground " and 7 000 miles are operable. By the end of the year he said 90 pct of the company's subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead of leased ATT lines) compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter. Fiber optic lines which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines is quicker more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter. "By the end of the year we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls " Holland said. He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S. long distance market with MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct. Holland said Sprint's rates which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year. At the same time he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January. "We've captured the fiber high ground shown the importance of it " he said. Concerning the deregulation of ATT Holland said he believed ATT "should be given some flexibility but should be regulated on pricing plans." "They're so dominant in the market place " he said adding that ATT should be deregulated when "there is true competition in the marketplace." "It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money " he said adding "maybe two to four years out it's hard to say." Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders such as the Belzberg family in Canada might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings. "They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint " he said adding that he was "amazed" at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing. "There's no evidence of that " he said. He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues number of customers and construction was on track even "ahead in many areas." Looking beyond the United States Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988. "We want to be in every country that ATT serves " he said. He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it. He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint the forerunner of US Sprint had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone network. Reuter

They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May. Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985. Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its "A" shares making a total of 54 cents after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985. Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits analysts said. The company's aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in &lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd> which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay. Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985 partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic. Swire's share of Cathay which stood at 70 pct before the flotation fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct. Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs. Tony Measor an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs. "Much depends on properties " said Measor. "And they did a lot better in the second half of the year." Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985. Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986 well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects. Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1 100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986. During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate benefiting from low interest rates analysts said. "At the end of last year flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1 100 dlrs per square foot up by about 20 pct from a year ago " said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year. The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986 according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd. Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

8600,TRAIN,true,false,SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 45.79 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT,Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AMS> unit &lt;Shell Australia Ltd> said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985. Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year. "A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct " he said. Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project. Duties royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation. "It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production " he said. "The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way " he said. Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business but further investment required an appropriate rate of return he said. Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier. Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth. REUTER

TMOC formerly the Moonie Oil Co Ltd said the valuation was made in response to an earlier and still current bid of 2.55 dlrs a share by &lt;Elders Resources Ltd>. Elders Resources holds 19.9 pct of TMOC's 62 mln shares. TMOC said it did not know Elders Resources' response to the bid or that of its other major shareholder the &lt;Australian Gas Light Co>. The latter has a 10.5 pct stake in TMOC. &lt;Avalon Corp> of the U.S. Has a 17 pct stake in TMOC through an option agreement.

The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams shares for every 50 in Norcros or 432.7p a share Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last night of 397p. A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms including a full cash alternative. The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations. The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros for a value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg. Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln. Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in the market for several months dealers said. Initially it centred on &lt;Bunzl Plc> which once held a 2.6 pct stake then switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares. Earlier this year Williams suggested holding talks with Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also result from normal trading. In the six months to end-September Norcros reported a rise in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its capitalisation up to around 380 mln. The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share worth 428p a share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400.2p a share. The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night's close at 750p. Williams said it held a total 850 000 shares in Norcros or 0.7 pct while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct. There was no immediate response from Norcros. REUTER

The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position they said. "It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions " said Simon Smithson an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management market research and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations " he said. "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries " said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With a historically high yen and historically low interest rates there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan." Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct he said. To stay competitive fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management " Smithson said. REUTER
8630,TRAIN,true,false,SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL,Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S> said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production particularly of oil and LPG along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct. Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism. But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme. "It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly " Massy-Green said.

The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc &lt;DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most profitable retailing group in the U.K. It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses. Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger talks with the high street pharmacist &lt;Underwoods Plc> had been called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended offer for &lt;Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>. The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct and retail profit by 37 pct with its pretax contribution of 45.5 mln making it the largest single component. The company said that the improvement had been achieved by substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins. In other sectors the Comet electrical chain raised retail profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg while the Woolworth chain reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln. The company said its property operations would increase substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with developers &lt;Rosehaugh Plc>. The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge. The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts. As a result the group's shares rose strongly peaking at 865p from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT. Reuter

Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985 despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985. The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985. Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986 which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company. In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB.

8820,TRAIN,true,false,LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U.K. UPSTREAM PROFIT,&lt;Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said. But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985. The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg he said. As a result post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln. Earlier Shell U.K. a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg up from 667 mln in 1985 on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln. Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373 000 bpd in 1986 which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340 000 bpd due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field he said. Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987 he said. A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months Reid said. The Kittiwake field originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg. Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields which were approved last year have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget. Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant. The company drilled 17 wells offshore with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries Reid said. Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985. Jaap Klootwijk managing director of downstream unit &lt;Shell U.K. Oil> said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a "bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986." In November and December in particular refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer although they could dip to become negative from time to time depending on price movements. A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988 about five months behind schedule following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year he said. Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site. Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT was "helpful " but rather less than had been hoped for. Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that he would expect some over-production above OPEC"s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down. He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding bringing supply and demand into balance but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall. Reuter

Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions both general and specific stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985. Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision. In all a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986 compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985. "The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region on top of the normal level of provisioning " Barber said. He said "the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks." Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning the Asia Pacific region made "a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits." He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was "well maintained although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning " while Californian subsidiary Union Bank "showed continued growth." "Tropical Africa Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued " he said. Barber said the group which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank &lt;LLOY.L> last year strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.

The group which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI> said it also obtained additional financing commitments including an increased commitment from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for non-public information about Cyclops that was previously provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's published financial projections. Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group which has a 90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight. The condition that was modified which required Cyacq to be satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons were rescinded or ineffective now says Cyclops shall not have paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the consummation of Cyacq's offer. Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on April three 1987 unless extended. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln dlrs from 250 mln dlrs. Additionally the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the new total 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.

8940,TRAIN,true,false,KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS,Eastman Kodak Co said it will reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber operations of its Eastman Chemicals division. A company spokesman said the company will take "some writeoff" in connection with the action in the first quarter and there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff in the second quarter. The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts. Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially-oriented filament yarn or POY at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia S.C. and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity mostly in Columbia. The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia most of which are now performed by contract workers and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport Tenn. Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30. Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year. The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand. It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.

8944,TRAIN,false,true,CONRAC &lt;CAX> SOARS FOLLOWING MARK IV &lt;IV> BID,Heavy buying by speculators boosted Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29 higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc &lt;IV>. "It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria " said one arbitrageur referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per share and ended when ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> found a white knight willing to bid 36.50 dlrs. For Conrac the arbitrageur said 28 dlrs per share seemed like an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early to project the outcome." "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr offer is inadequate " the second arbitrageur said. But he added it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today. He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is able to thwart Mark IV. Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it would make a recommendation by April 17. A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a determined bidder. "They're not beginners " he said. Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find another buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses " he said. "There is only a small universe of people who would want to own the company as it's presently structured." Conrac is involved in video displays computer software aircraft instruments telephone answering machines welding equipment and other products. "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for those who can take the risk " said Rudolph Hokanson analyst at Milwaukee Co. He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV "fair value but on the low side." "I don't think management was looking for a buyer in any way before this offer " he said. Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche markets. He said management has done a good job of turning around the telephone answering machine business. Reuter

8964,TRAIN,true,false,PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986,The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100 000 barrels a day Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986 down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986 totalled 43.5 billion a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said "had a very serious impact on Venezuela." PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day of which 658 000 bpd were crude oil and 850 000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323 000 bpd in 1985 to 342 000 bpd last year. However Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164 000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes Hernandez said. Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels the fourth largest amount in the world Hernandez said. Reuter

Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987 compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year. Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years. The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987. During 1986 the company cut operating administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12 500. Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained. "It is still a time for prudence and caution and the company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand " he said. Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products division are more promising than before but are still uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985. Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States. The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices. Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986 compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter

The transaction is expected to be completed by September 30. CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are completed it said. The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings should be positive it added as it will allow capital expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the European business. The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced in November CPC said. Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was part of the restructuring. As of December 31 CPC had bought about 15 mln of its common shares adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January for a total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs according to its 1986 annual report. In December CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a total of about 170 mln dlrs. CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt including that incurred under the share buyback. In total CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common stock adjusted for the split it said today. In November it authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares adjusted for the split. The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in November after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman chairman of Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV> acquired about 7.6 pct of CPC's then outstanding stock. In 1986 the European corn wet milling business had sales of 914.1 mln dlrs operating income before overheads of 68.8 mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln dlrs according to CPC's 1986 annual report.

It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of special preferred stock. The KSZ offer Resorts said indicates that KSZ has a commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special preferred stock. Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27. It said it asked its investment advisor Bear Stearns and Co to advise its board on the offer. Earlier this month the estate of James M. Crosby and certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the 752 297 class B shares outstanding. Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining class B shares outstanding. Resorts also has about 5 680 000 shares of outstanding class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting power of the class B shares. Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>. Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ existing class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire Resorts. Resorts said the new company upon completion of the merger would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the special preferred stock would immediately be converted into exchangeable participating preferred of the new company. This preferred Resorts said would pay a dividend based on the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island operations. A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has asked Bear Sterns to obtain complete data he said. The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis the Denver oilman. Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters who handles public relations for Davis. Solters said to be travelling was not immediately available for comment. Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment as was a spokesman for the Crosby estate. Reuter

"We can double our earnings over the next five to seven years " he told a banking analysts meeting adding that this forecast may be on the conservative side. He said that bank card operations and the New York branch system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked out other developing areas such as U.S. mortgage and international consumer as major potential earners. Braddock and his sector heads made the following more specific predictions: - Cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the U.S. bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's relatively inflated levels. - Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986. - The international consumer business will show 22 pct compound annual growth in earnings between 1986 and 1992. - Private banking earnings will hit 100 mln dlrs in 1987 and top 200 mln dlrs in 1992.

9110,TRAIN,false,true,MERGERS  PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS,Automobile dealerships have become large multi-store operations and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year. Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public analysts say. Retail car sales "are at a point of transition. There's not much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" about ways to sell cars says David Cole analyst with the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. The retail car market is "much more freeform now" than it was in 1956 the year things began to change says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates. Thirty years ago in 1956 the situation was different. Dealerships sold one kind of car--a "Chevy" or a Ford or a Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738 000 dlrs worth of vehicles according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen Beatle--began to gain popularity. The "Bug" caused "a rebellion" among dealers who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers says Jauppi. One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships auto analysts say. Last year the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers. "I had one of these guys tell me he makes six seven mln dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money " says Cole. "There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars " he says. With the increase in size large dealers have been buying up other dealerships and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up. Donald Keithley vice president dealer services for J.D. Power a California-based market research firm says that by 1990 12 000 people will own dealerships compared to 16 800 principal owners today. Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises some of which might compete against each other. "It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines " Jauppi says. As dealers get bigger industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations. Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers "are obviously thinking of very seriously " says Cole. Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares. "Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. It could happen any time " Jauppi says. "If you look at the whole merger mania and look at the scale some of these dealers it's going to be very hard to resist taking them public " said another analyst. And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international. "We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide " he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe where the market will expand faster than the U.S. he says. "It's not totally off the wall " says Cole. Reuter

Under the plan Chapman will exchange securities and cash for all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due 2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners Ltd. The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln dlrs partially secured by a first mortgage lien on the company's interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and Troon to tender 100 000 principal amount of debentures to Chapman. Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of the restructuring. Troon will acquire a majority stock interest and control of the board. In addition Chapman and Troon will establish a 10 mln dlrs acquisition joint ventures it said. The plan also contemplates establishing a restructured loan providing for one master credit agreement having an aggregate balance of 22.4 mln dlrs. The plan also contemplates the recapitalization of preferred stock whereby each share will be converted into three shares of common stock. Chapman also said it also plans to negotiate settelment and discharge of a substantial portion of its accounts payable and settlement of certain litigation. If approved by various creditors and shareholders the company expects the plan to be completed by May 29. Chapman also repoted a loss of 43.4 mln dlrs for the year including asset writedowns of 35.5 mln dlrs compared to December 31 compared to a net income of 177 243 in 1985.

9139,TRAIN,true,false,JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986,A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986 stock analysts said. They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales. Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises among them Canon cameras Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business which will increase its overall retail income figures. Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services mainly its 50 pct share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985. Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985 while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs. But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985 they said. Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests. It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest. A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand. Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units it is likely to develop its own business analysts said. "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions " said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett. He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business. REUTER
9142,TRAIN,true,false,CHINA'S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT,China's first joint venture bank Xiamen International Bank (XIB) reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 the bank's first full year of operation. General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast saying targets were under study. Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln he told Reuters. Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;Luso International Bank Ltd> in Macao. The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986. Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd> had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake he said. Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268 000 dlrs in 1985. The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Fujian branch whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15 Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10). One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks. The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated he added. Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker who asked not to be named said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the state-owned Agricultural Bank of China Xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices mostly of Hong Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs. Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations. It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5 000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states. The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year or about one third of EC production from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals. Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products. It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake and the major cereal trader. It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.

The company estimated parent company current losses at 15 billion yen in 1986/87 including a gain of 95 billion yen from the sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen profit a year earlier. Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2 150 billion yen down from 2 685 billion a year ago. Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report parent company results in late May. Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57 mln tonnes down from 27.98 mln a year earlier. Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April 1 are unavailable yet he said. REUTER

The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39 billion which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions. Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper. Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume. The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT. BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms. Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth. Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U.K. Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion. Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half. Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio at 26 pct left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development. Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg nearly three times the 1982 level with Wiggins Teape's sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg. BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S. For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg. REUTER

The company which gave no 1986 profit figures posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985. It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices. Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar. It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations. Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates issued in October 1986 will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a quarter of the 1986 payment or around 2.50 marks the company added. REUTER
9206,TRAIN,true,false,SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR,Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector chairman Michael Miles said. He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio." He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago. Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>. Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business primarily in Hong Kong. Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago. Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's flights and fleet load factor is still holding up at 70 pct. He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs." "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year " he said "though there might be a bit of increase later this year.'' Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations even though the marine sector is generally depressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better " he said. The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year. Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion. He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate.

First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution of West Virginia Power which became a division on March 1 1987 Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts. Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate increases in Iowa Minnesota Kansas and Colorado he said. However Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized in September 1986 he noted. Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first quarter about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas operations he said. Operating income derived from electric operations in the first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln dlrs Green said.

Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver to extend the deadline to May 31 1987 for completion of the company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British Columbia due to a longer than expected regulatory approval process he said.

9408,TRAIN,true,false,BAT SHARES UNDERVALUED  SAY STOCK MARKET ANALYSTS,BAT Industries Plc &lt;BTI.L> 1986 results which were at the upper end of market expectations showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued share analysts said. BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax. Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price. "In the current market people almost expect companies to beat expectations " said one analyst adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast. BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion. Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs. BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago. Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance. He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial services in particular in the U.S. Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" in sight in the near future.

Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer on March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares.

9549,TRAIN,true,false,FERC DECISION COULD CUT COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> NET,Columbia Gas System Inc said a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25 dlrs a share. The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 below Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs per share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986. It said management expects to recommend to the board that the dividend rate be maintained in 1987. Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax liabilities under the new federal tax laws. The company recorded these liabilities based on older higher tax rates but an action being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987 it explained. "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987 earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned " Columbia Gas said. Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas Transmission Corp the company's principal pipeline subsidiary. It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.

Last year SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs including a small extraordinary gain. In 1987 a total manufacturing activities will generate about 235 mln dlrs in revenues and engineering and construction about 200 mln dlrs he said adding that defense products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

9582,TRAIN,false,true,U.S. SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS,The Securities Industry Association backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider trading in law. The industry trade association called on U.S. securities firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to guard against illegal trading by employees. The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers. But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate. The SIA in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages. The report said securities firms "should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis." It said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information. It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market. It said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing. In the mergers and acquisitions area the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval. It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under current law disclosure may be made as late as ten days after exceeding the five pct limit. The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no limit on open market purchases. The group said the federal government should preempt state regulation of defensive takeover tactics. The group said all tender offers should remain open for at least 30 calendar days. The current requirement is expressed in business days. It said so-called "lockup" devices in which securities are issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the target company's total common stock. Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading and fairness in the marketplace.

In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report the regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings dilution it expects from the acquisitions which total some 1.38 billion dlrs. However the company said the rise in its debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level within an acceptable range. In its 1986 yearend financial statement Southwestern Bell listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct down slightly from 43.7 pct in 1985. In 1986 the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs or 10.26 dlrs a share compared with 996.2 mln dlrs or 10 dlrs a share in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion dlrs. Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a negative impact on its cash flow due mainly to the loss of investment tax credits. By mid-year however the company said a reduced corporate tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and cash flow. In addition the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct increase in long distance calling volumes. Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986 a year in which expenditures were held below budget. Reuter

In a filing with the ICC late today the company outlined four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific. Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date and that the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged from today onward. "We are willing even eager to make a fair market value offer in cash for the Southern Pacific " said Kansas City Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H. Rowland. "This offer disproves the constant derogation of the Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management best exemplified by SFSP Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt '" said Rowland. He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime competitor Santa Fe. Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to 1.2 billion dlrs. It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their merger appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and 800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations. Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for Southern after its books records and properties are examined. "Once that examination has been completed (and even in the absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an offer in writing...." said the company. Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern Pacific two railroads that it said basically parallel each other throughout their routes. ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements with the Union Pacific the Denver and Rio Grande Western and other railroads adds to the value of the merger.

9638,TRAIN,false,true,GENCORP &lt;GY> BID COULD BE RAISED  GROUP SAYS,An investor group said it might be willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so far the company has turned down requests for a meeting. "We might be able to see some additional value if we could meet" and get more financial data said Joel Reed speaking for the investor group. Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds "was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this time." Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone conversation with Reynolds Reed said. Wagner and Brown along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs. Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share tender offer which expires April 15 is a fair offer. GenCorp gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE. Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his group wins control. He said aerospace soft drink bottling and entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He said the tire business which the group wants to keep may be more viable if merged with another tire company. "One option would be to try to grow the tire business through combination or an acquisition " Reed said. He said he believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the tire industry. Gary Miller chief financial officer of AFG said his company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit sharing have been used with success he said. In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's shoes and proceed with plans to sell the stations. The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc &lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the station for 387 mln dlrs. The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs and Fidelilty Television which challenged the license would get about 103 mln dlrs. The partners also said the Federal Communications Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving comments on their request for special temporary authorization of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal application for transfer of the broadcast unit. Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule because it provides time for the agency to act on the request before the expiration of the tender offer. He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations. Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by some municipal officials in Akron Ohio where GenCorp is headquartered Reed said "the plan of the partners offers long term growth for Ohio." He noted that the aerospace business slated for divestiture under the partners' plan is located in California. "Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest long term growth for all segments " he said. Reuter

Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs compared to a year-earlier profit of 3.9 mln dlrs. Varity said continued deterioration in major markets a weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss. Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode during the latest fiscal year with worldwide industry retail sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's depressed levels the company said.

While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986 incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level. World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge. World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks. Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks. The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.

9731,TRAIN,false,true,BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET TENDER,
9733,TRAIN,false,true,BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES,British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash for a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted. The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc> unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered. BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and non-public information. Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs down 1-3/4 dlrs. BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night's close. About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's own resources. The remainder would come from new borrowings partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities. BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest. BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment. Walters added that it also felt that due to management changes in 1986 Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment. Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs. Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise. One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled. BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago. It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the 1987/88 financial year analysts said. Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets. The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently he said. However with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good. Standard was a high cost oil producer the analysts noted. Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus. BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard which was strong on marketing and refining was short on crude oil. The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year. The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer Spedding said. BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets. The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors.

9734,TRAIN,true,false,HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES,Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985 with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985 a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels 1987 sales will again be below the previous year although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986 Hoechst said. Sales of paints and dyes fibres sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell. Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company other units in West Germany and to &lt;American Hoechst Corp>. Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities. Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985. Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies and a fall in extraordinary costs. The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies Hoechst said. The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new projects up from 294 mln marks in 1985 went on the capital increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the acquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>. Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to form &lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp>. REUTER
9736,TRAIN,true,false,BHP NET SEEN AROUND 600 MLN DLRS FOR NINE MONTHS,Australia's largest company The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> (BHP) is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28 share analysts polled by Reuters said. This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs. The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter. BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier. The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings. They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems. The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs. One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division they said. They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit. REUTER

9742,TRAIN,false,true,BP UNITS SEEK FIVE BILLION DLR REVOLVING CREDIT,BP International and BP North America are seeking a five billion dlr four year syndicated credit facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc's tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger. The facility to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in Europe bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own for 70 dlrs a share cash. The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced earlier BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be used to support that program. The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and the dealers have not yet been chosen. The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue cash advances with maturities of one three or six months through a tender panel which will be comprised of banks committed to the facility. Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among BP's relationship banks. As a result banks were being offered lead manager status at 200 mln dlrs co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at 75 mln. Although pricing on many credit facilities has become extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition to win mandates Morgan Guaranty said banks would be compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility which must be completed quickly with signing expected in about 10 days.

9760,TRAIN,true,false,SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR,World group turnover of Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said. Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks. Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87 about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct. In the first five 1986/87 months turnover abroad showed a three pct increase Kaske said without giving figures. In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period. For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion. Apart from payments for the nuclear power station the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year Kaske said. But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar Kaske said. Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year. Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology communications and telecommunications sectors but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline. Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary. Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar. While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86. Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level. Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. REUTER
9761,TRAIN,true,false,KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS,The Fried. Krupp GmbH &lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year. Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion it said in a preliminary statement. Despite these figures which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector which accounted for 42 pct of total sales. Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities. An orders decline in the steel and in particular the trading and services sectors affected the group's total order figures. However "all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986 " Krupp added without giving details. Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985. Orders received by the machinery and plant sector 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion Krupp said. The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year. Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985 it said. The steel market weakened increasingly over the year mainly because of exchange rate movements the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries. The difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct Krupp said. But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold-rolled flats grew by five pct in tonnage terms. REUTER

Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided on two years ago as claimed by AT and T. The French government which owns CGCT had asked Siemens at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT. The result of the negotiations was still open. Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer. The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman James E.

CGCT's share of the French switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct. The French government has limited CGCT participation by foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs for the whole company.

Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm &lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT. Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct.

9978,TRAIN,false,true,FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION,Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought. In a wide-ranging interview Pinola said he's looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991 "so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence if possible." In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California. First Interstate the fourth largest California bank and the nineth largest nationwide owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states. Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U.S. or foreign banks looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region. While declining specifics on his corporate strategy when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan Pinola replied "That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that." Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as "opportunistic". He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain then add management to restore profitability or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates then cut costs by combining resources. The exception he said would be Texas where he said most of the banks are already well managed but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy. Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica saying only "We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us." Banking analysts however consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot not likely to happen any time soon. Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank "a very very difficult decision." With that decision made however he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community. "The competition in this state is tough " he said noting CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth " he said. Outside California Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp with its recent acquisitions in Arizona Washington and Oregon is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated. "Security is has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company " he said. He added however First Interstate at the moment has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name. Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states where energy real estate and agriculture dominate the economy. Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked he said "I don't think it has bottomed out because I think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years." Pinola said another failing economic sector agriculture in the Midwest has slowed expansion of First Interstate's franchise operation. First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states. While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West expansion into the Midwest must come first. Calling the franchise system "moderately profitable " Pinola said "It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two." On the banking industry in general Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits. Reuter

10049,TRAIN,false,true,FED'S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING,Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking insurance real estate and securities. In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank and Financial Analysts' Association Heller said "I believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system." He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank thrift insurance investment securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines. "Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions and all transactions would have to be on an arms-length basis " Heller said. Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries. Heller said he "would require the holding company to serve as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank's capital. "In other words the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth." Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary. Heller said the effects of these actions "would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them" in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to "loot the bank" was removed. Such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the United States. Heller said that would mean "the steady decline of America's banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested" by permitting them to become more competitive. Reuter

"We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game " he told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of Standard's stock. Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst whom he would not identify as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer. "I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation " he said. "Let's wait and see how the offer runs." Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid. The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company's assets including the value of its oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC> paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow. The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard's stock price over the past year. BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be financed by new debt. BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit he explained. The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months he added. Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly held shares are held by financial institutions. Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time. He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition. "We have informed Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves " he pointed out. Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production. "We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime " Simon said. "We have hopes for greater stability but we do not see prices going much higher " he added. Reuter

"We have terminated our discussions " Roderick told Reuters after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other possible buyer of its energy assets. Earlier today BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD> publicly held stock. USX said in December the company had held formal discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of interest from a half dozen other oil companies.

In response to a question Roderick also said he did not know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was accumulating USX stock. In recent days traders have suggested Holmes a Court was buying additional shares. Roderick said Carl Ichan who terminated an eight billion dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January continued to hold a sizable interest in the company. "Mr. Ichan still apparently has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any " Roderick said. "He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I talk with him monthly." In his speech Roderick predicted the fall in the value of the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986. "I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net trade surplus " Roderick said. "I think the worst is over and we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead." However the USX chairman warned that European trading partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. "Some economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States to our friends trading partners and allies." Reuter

10168,TRAIN,false,true,BP &lt;BP> MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID -  ANALYSTS,British Petroleum Co PLC may have to raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly traded shares of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> analysts said. "There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid " said Rosario Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild. And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today that BP would raise the offer the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility. Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell Group's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share after lawsuits by minority shareholders. "I think they're going to have to go a little higher eventually just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares " Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share. Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After objections from minority shareholders about the price Royal Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984. But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase. It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake a significant premium to its original bid of about 5.2 billion dlrs. The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon. Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share. Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason they said. Goldman Sachs and Co BP's investment advisor advised the Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985. Reuter

10233,TRAIN,true,false,GREAT AMERICAN &lt;GTAM> SEES CHARGE  WRITEDOWN,Great American Corp said preliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK subsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mln dlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs. The charge will be made against the allowance for possible loan losses and the writedown is of other real estate. Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular examination and a final report is not expected for several weeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown in response to the preliminary findings. Great American said regulatory authorities are not requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial results for Great American for 1986. However Great American has revised its previous estimates of provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to the allowance account as of December 31 1986. It said it took the action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment does not show signs for significant improvement in the near future. It said the additional provision increases the allowance to 26.4 mln dlrs representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan portfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end. Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth quarter is 14.1 mln dlrs or 6.36 dlrs per share compared to a net loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year earlier. Reuter

BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend. Commenting on the year's performance the company said it suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.

Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two dlrs. A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share while the "A" share dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a share. Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985. Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985 the statement said. It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> Jardine Fleming Co Ltd and its business in Japan. He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation is "a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance." Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group "the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group's recent restructuring." He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm's shareholders and warrant holders adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price. The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- &lt;Mandarin Oriental International Ltd> and &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd> -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson. Jardine Matheson which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs last year will become debt free after the restructuring. "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals continuing into 1987 has transformed our balance sheet " Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in airfreight operations Australian properties and trucking business and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities. Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its general trading business in the Middle East in view of the continuing weakness of oil prices Keswick said. But he said the operations would be profitable in the longer term. He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarily of strategy structure and financial and personnel policy." He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific regional board. He gave no further details of the change. Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm planned a rights issue. REUTER
10292,TRAIN,true,false,BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET,The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> said it expects a strong full year result helped by sigificant investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter but net will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86 ended May 31. The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier. Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31 BHP said in a statement. Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs. BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1. The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1. The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend BHP said. BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital. The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation it said. As previously reported dividends will become tax-free in shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate. BHP which confined comment to the third quarter said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln. BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties. The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project it said. The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain all in the third term reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of &lt;Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown. REUTER

In a letter sent yesterday Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S. Firms that have expressed interest. But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role he said. The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete with the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd> and to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> industry analysts and diplomats said. One of the rival firms &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms including General Electric Co &lt;GE> Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Citibank NA &lt;CCI) and two European companies ITJ president Nobuo Ito said yesterday. Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second potential KDD rival &lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc> along with &lt;C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC> both of the U.S. Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor. It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier such as Cable and Wireless arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists. Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy Jonathan Solomon yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct the ministry official said. Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless' share industry analysts said. "Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor " Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said. "Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up to a certain amount but you won't find any one company with an extraordinarily large holding " Whitten said. Western diplomatic sources were more blunt. "They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of strategies to reduce that share " one said. Fumio Watanabe a senior Keidanren (a leading business organization) official who has been trying to arrange the merger will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday the ministry official said.

Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with &lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd>. Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake in Progressive to 52 pct.

The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would offer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full bid for Progressive and it follows much public debate between BIL and Rainbow. BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he opposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees Progressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.

10398,TRAIN,true,false,PORSCHE EXPECTS IMPROVEMENT IN U.S. SALES,Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactory profit in 1986/87 with domestic volume sales seen lower but U.S. Sales anticipated higher. Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales were expected to fall to 9 000 in the year ending July 31 from 11 340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30 000 from 28 670 last year. Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70 mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86. For sales Porsche expects its overall world volume this year to be above 50 000. Sales last year stood at 53 254 Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting he added. The expected drop in West German sales this year would be the result of the so-called "grey market" for Porsche cars he said. When the dollar was strong against the mark many Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal export to the U.S. Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87 first half fell to 3 267 from 5 387 in the same 1985/86 period. The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose problems for profit the Porsche board said. In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around 20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the 1986/87 business year finance director Heinz Branitzki. Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln marks. In a speech to the annual meeting Schutz said third-party orders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre in Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for the first time. Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85. REUTER

Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts Douglas Danforth Westinghouse's chairman said the company's sales growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989 "given an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth course." He also said the company will make acquisitions but he did not specify particular targets. Paul E. Lego senior executive vice president told the analysts "our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr acquisition even though our balance sheet can handle one. Despite this disclaimer if we identify a major acquisition that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will consider it." He said the company would consider an acquisition candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's primiary businesses. Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key areas including defense electronics financial services broadcasting electrical products and services for construction and industrial and utility markets. Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow faster than the markets the corportation serves and "surely faster than GNP." He said earnings per share growth is expected to consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range. Leo W. Yochum senior executive vice president for finance told the analysts "we will consider buying back stock" but there are no current plans for such a buyback. Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder value. Last year Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said the company spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344 mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in 1988.

McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln dlrs for six vessels certain port facilities and various other equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and theree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two McLean subsidiaries. As previously announced U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer its South American Service to &lt;Crowley Maritime Corp>'s American Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed lease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a participation based on American Transport's South American revenues. McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release U.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for three vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have been returned to Crowley. McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln dlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four years at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition U.S. Lines (S.A.) subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American Transport. The company said both agreements in principle have been approved by directors of the companies involved but still need court regulatory and lender approval.

But total operating and extraordinary profits including earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms were more than double the previous year's level AMB said. BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's capital increase which is to finance the insurance company's acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG. Despite the fall in partial operating profits BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company &lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG> from which AMB has acquired the majority stake. The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat. AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to 50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus. The interest surplus which fell to 897.9 mln marks from 981.1 mln was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the interest margin to 1.9 pct. A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from 188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this. The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up risk provisions with country risks particularly emphasised because of the continuing difficulties of some countries. Disclosed risk provisions which under West German accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln. BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in 1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct of this credit volume and Latin American debtors accounted for 14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.

But in a statement accompanying year-end figures the group said it expected satisfactory business development over the next months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary influences such as there were last year " it said. Orders in hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level. BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985. The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and forced price declines for petrochemical products BASF said. The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In the parent company the positive earnings development continued it said where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to 1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in raw materials. In 1986 world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47 billion marks compared to 1985 BASF said. Parent turnover fell 8.5 pct to 18.72 billion. Turnover increases with the exceptions of the sectors fine chemicals and informations systems had only been achieved in those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985. Results from these had been taken only partly into the fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.

Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want a majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was seeking to buy only a minority holding in the company which has annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17 000.

General Acquisition said it is aware the board may be reviewing alternative transactions which might provide GenCorp shareholders with a payment other than cash. "If that is the case you should recognize that our additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide in any similarly structured transaction " the partnership said. General Acquisition also said it believes that GenCorp's board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for competing offers. The partnership requested that if any other proposal is under consideration that it be given the same information available to GenCorp's managers and advisers in constructing a proposal. General Acquisition said that if GenCorp agrees to accept another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision is made. General Acquisition repeated its request that GenCorp remove its "poison pill" or shareholders rights plan. General Acquisition said if GenCorp does not allow an "environment for fair competition " it will take all steps necessary to create such an enviroment. It said it may take legal action or seek the support of shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board and to consider other proposals it might develop.

The Bass Group which holds 24.9 pct of Taft said it had talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers and directors "concerning participation in a group to acquire control" of the company. The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft stockholders and members of Taft management about participating in a group to acquire control. The group which is led by the wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth Texas did not identify any of the other people with whom it had talks. Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion dlr offer for the company. At the time the company said it authorized its adviser Goldman Sachs and Co to explore other takeover proposals and to supply financial data to other interested bidders. "If indeed the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president is because the bass group tossed him out I couldn't see them backing him on any deal " said one analyst who asked not to be identified. "I think they wanted a way out. Now this sounds like they're going to join the group and buy themselves out " said Edward Atorino media analyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co.

"The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest " the DOT said in a statement. AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a unit of AMR Corp. The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan Feb. 20. American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not alter American's third-place ranking according to data compiled by Aviation Daily a leading industry trade magazine. The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S. market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct the DOT said. The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers provide either nonstop or single-plane service. At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers the DOT said it found no evidence that other carriers could not increase or begin service that competed with a merged American-AirCal. Concerning the 14th "While entry may not be possible at the Orange County Airport in the near future DOT found that the service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area especially at the Los Angeles International Airport will provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in long-haul markets " the DOT said. The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County terminal where environmental concerns and a small terminal building limit future opportunities for expansion. The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments opposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments." Under the merger terms announced Nov. 17 American will pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings. Reuter

11123,TRAIN,true,false,CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS,Canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if as expected major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same " Levesque Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative " said Pulcine "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don't there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not." Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp &lt;CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks. "In order to make that strategy work they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks " said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank which he declined to identify "wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position." Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending July 31. &lt;Bank of Montreal> Brazil's largest Canadian bank creditor said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing. "I think that is just for the benefit of the public " Walsh said of Bank of Montreal's statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31 thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income. "From what Brazil has said it is quite likely the banks will get the money " said Meredith. "My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings." Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with 2.23; 2.15 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94 and 2.85 dlrs for &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for &lt;National Bank of Canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs. "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario " Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested however that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year." He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings. Reuter

Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which earned 1.019 billion bolivars the first time since 1978 Sidor turned a profit.

Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the full value of the company. In a letter to shareholders Chairman A. William Reynolds said the offer is a "highly conditional contingently financed bust-up offer" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value of their investment in Gencorp. Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He said the board has authorized management to explore alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a "financially superior" alternative to the general acquisition offer. A Gencorp spokesman in response to questions would not comment on market speculation that the company's management may develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not comment on when a better alternative might be developed. Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer price since the tender was made. Today Gencorp closed at 114-1/4 up 1-5/8. Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder value and the stock price and earnings have improved since he joined the company. Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a "bargain price" acquisition that was "using financing from a syndicate of banks that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide." Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets including Aerojet General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of shareholders.

The partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive particularly since it had attempted to discuss the offer with Gencorp.

11171,TRAIN,true,false,WOODSIDE SAYS LOSS REFLECTS LOWER OIL PRICES,Woodside Petroleum Ltd &lt;WPLA.S> said its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices combined with a large tax provision. Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to 17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985 although group revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln. It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely related to its &lt;Vamgas Ltd> unit non-allowable exchange losses and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not recognised in the accounts. Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the Shelf project against six month sales in 1985. Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit. Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas. Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale would be included in the 1987 accounts.

The sale is effective from tomorrow they said in a joint statement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd> which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's interests in the next two years the statement said. "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float " CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier he said. As reported separately soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs. After Bass Strait the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current gross oil production of 45 000 barrels per day (BDP) gas liquids output of 30 000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic feet a day the CSR-Esso statement said. The purchase gives Esso a 50/50 partner with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait its first onshore production in Australia they said. Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the Cooper-Eromanga area. "These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass Strait production now under way " McGill said. In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders Kelman said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso. He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision in view of the risks associated with the oil business. The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years he said. Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to net realisable value as of today CSR's annual balance-date will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs. However revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss he said. He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents against 18 in 1985/86.

"It sounds like a good deal " Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goode and Co> told Reuters. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR already Australia's largest sugar refiner made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>. "This will be a big shock to the market which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi " McKibbin said. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products analysts said. CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years. Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin. Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs. Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd> said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company. "The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans " Goldston-Morris said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country analysts said. They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year they said. Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment made in 1981 which has dragged down the company's overall performance analysts said. CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt they said. "It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely with debt the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them " Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Meares and Philips Ltd> said. Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions. Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>. "Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production " Goldston-Morris said.

Managers responded well to the demand for lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.

Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986 Dieter said. Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986. Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a set- back although measures to cut costs which were started last year were now having an effect. Dieter noted however that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims." He said the company's drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus point" for Mannesmann. Mannesmann which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks. It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe.

11253,TRAIN,false,true,PARTNERS CALL GENCORP &lt;GY> RESPONSE UNPRODUCTIVE,General Acquisition Co said it was disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and asked how the company might give better value to shareholders. Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from General Acquisition an affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc and said it was studying financially superior alternatives. The General Acquisition partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive particularly since it had tried to discuss the offer with Gencorp. The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plans that make takeovers more expensive. Gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned to put off the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock to April 6 from April 3. It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditional on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp before April 6. General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.

Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was aimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right." European Sugar wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M> is expected to absorb the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy. Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs. A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit but gave no details. The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business. In London yesterday chairman of Belgian starch producer &lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi was "apparently still organising finance " his company might still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business. Gardini commenting on Callebaut's remarks said the 630 mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid "at the date foreseen in the preliminary contract." Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in European Sugar but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by September 30. Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's European business was apparently rejected in favour of Ferruzzi's lower bid. Gardini commenting on Callebaut's remarks said "Amylum should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case of the acquisition of CPC's European business." Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under study he added. Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC business Gardini said: "We do not exclude having minority partners in the CPC business."

Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from reductions in personnel and other savings such as reductions in exploration expenses were reflected in an 880 mln dlr reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985. The company said its more efficient operations would be necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead. The company also said that its share repurchase plan contributed to the per share gains over 1985. In a breakdown of costs Exxon said that operating expenses slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the previous year and exploration expenses including dry holes slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the same period as the number of wells drilled was lower. The company was also able to use lower interest rates to reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627 mln dlrs the previous year. Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6 pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct. On December 31 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs down from 4.8 billion dlrs in 1985. Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its treasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of shares to 722.6 mln shares from 754.1 mln shares the previous year. Reuter

11490,TRAIN,true,false,CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER,Canada's airline industry shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years industry analysts said. "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada " said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. "Clearly it can go head-to-head in any market." The new airline which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market against Air Canada's 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. They said CP Air's management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada formed 50 years ago because neither airline was held accountable to its owners. "Not that long ago maybe even just six months ago these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line " said Bradley. "But with CP Air being run by Eyton it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way " he said. CP Air always fighting for market share rather than profits was "a perennial money-loser " analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985 its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986 analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain. "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else's " Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair preferring strong medicine now instead of later already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines which has 81 aircraft last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines with its newer fleet needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter
11492,TRAIN,false,true,GENCORP &lt;GY> ALTERNATIVE PLAN DUE WITHIN A WEEK,A. William Reynolds chairman and chief executive of GenCorp Inc told shareholders he expects to announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile tender within a week. Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient saying the group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate GenCorp while "we have had only 10 days to respond." Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV serving the New York City market and expects to complete the sale by Friday. Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to sell the station to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has already approved the station's sale. Money from the sale of the station will play a role in helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown Reynolds said. He provided no other details. Randall Hubbard chairman of AFG and Joel Reed chief financial officer of Wagner and Brown attended the meeting which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About 300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm. Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters. Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members have been telling him "Bill just don't pay greenmail" to end the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds said he considers it a "repugnant device." Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors. Mario Gabelli head of a New York investment firm which owns a large block of stock proposed one nominee for the board. Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to "stiffen the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail." Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they are open to negotiations with GenCorp. Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the event of a shift in control of the company Reynolds asserted "we're developing alternatives that would not result in a change in control." Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown Reynolds commented "We know the company we know the values and we know the opportunities better than any outside group." In response to a question about whether any units are up for sale he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives. Reuter

11504,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR>,Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer either from GAF or its own management analysts believe. Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading. Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. "It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin) Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively they want to remain independent " said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps. Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year. Last week Jacobs' investment vehicle Minstar Inc and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln Borg-Warner shares. The same day GAF Corp raised its stake by 9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding. Jacobs was interested in buying the company but took no steps toward a transaction. "Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate battles I've seen " said one analyst. The battle however has heated up and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate. Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner. Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp but GAF benefited from that company's restructuring. "Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per share " said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson. Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and carried out a wider share repurchase. Arbitragers however said they do not believe Heyman is seeking "greenmail " or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium. Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction. Previously associated with "junk bond" experts Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the tender offer and merger. Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts however believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction. GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today to 48-5/8. "I believe obviously if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially " said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose. He said at 46 dlrs per share Heyman's average cost for the company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's current holdings. Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman. Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings. The plastics are used in telephone equipment office equipment and appliances. "Borg has half the market in the U.S. and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator " Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> and Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC> he said. Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business and a protective systems business which includes Wells Fargo security guards. It also has an information services business and is trying to sell its financial services business. Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF in 1986 earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs. GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer a special union carbide dividend and the sale of its Union Carbide shares. Reuter

He said it would take several weeks for the company to complete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcement officials involved at this time.

The property and casualty insurance company's chairman and chief executive officer Martin J.

The company is currently licenced to operate only in New York state. Simon estimated that the company would earn seven cts a share in the first quarter compared to three cts in the same quarter a year ago and eight cts a share in the second quarter compared to five cts earned in 1986. He expects the company to earn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of 1987. In addition Simon said First Central Financial "is actively looking for and has several acquisition brokers looking for a small life insurance company to acquire." He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr range and will be part of a strategy of expanding the company into a "wide spectrum of insurance services." No specific company has been targeted as yet "but I would like to make my first acquisition in 1987 " he said. He said First Central Financial would not itself be an easy takeover target.

"We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement " Heyman said following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers annual meeting. "We don't have any particular changes in mind." Earlier today GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offer was presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-based company. Last week GAF had purchased additional shares of the company for 40-1/8 dlrs increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to 19.9 pct. In 1985 GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs and has since expressed an interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement its own chemical business. When asked whether GAF would consider selling the non-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer is accepted Heyman declined to comment. He also refused to say whether GAF would consider increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the initial proposal is rejected. Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to Borg-Warner to be a friendly one. "We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warner management and good for its shareholders " Heyman said. In his speech Heyman said he feared too many chemical companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin niche products. He said they were turning their backs on core commodity chemical businesses. Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of seven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past two years to trim balance sheets. He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry which reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits would see a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing exports cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

11711,TRAIN,true,false,DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN,Dome Petroleum Ltd earlier reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier profit of 7.0 mln dlrs said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses the company said. "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years " Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome " chairman Macdonald said. "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company's assets in today's economic environment and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued existence " he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets taken mainly in the third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at September 30 under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs which are used in the new accounting calculations it said. As a result Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10 pct discount factor in the calculations which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71 billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also contributed to the decline it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79 pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago 542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0 mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity. Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales it said. Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled 86 000 barrels a day compared to 87 000 bpd in the prior year. Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day from 591.0 mcf a day.

The accounting change will not affect the company's cash position and the company intends to continue paying its dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share. Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs or 2.60 dlrs per share. Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project. It said the commission is currently allowing the company to recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants. As a result 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month as deferred non-cash account receivable which has been included in current income. But the accounting change effective January 1 will reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by the commission Pacific Gas and Electric said. It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the 5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to recover in rates. The company further stated that it is confident it will receive an objective review of the facts. It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates. Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power units in 1969. After a number of construction delays unit one went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in March last year.

11752,TRAIN,true,false,AUDITORS GIVE FIRST CITY &lt;FBT> QUALIFIED OPINION,First City Bancorp of Texas which lost a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986 said in its annual report it expected operating losses to continue "for the foreseeable future" as it continues to search for additional capital or a merger partner. The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received a qualified opinion from its auditors Arthur Andersen and Co. The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City eventually obtaining additional capital. "The company believes that in order to address its long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of operations it will ultimately need several hundred million dollars of additional capital or a combination with a more strongly capitalized entity " First City said in a note to its financial statements included in the annual report. "Management believes that sufficient resources should be available to cover interim capital concerns while additional capital is being sought " the bank said. To raise cash in the near-term First City said it may sell or mortgage non-strategic assets recover excess contributions to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of its member banks. "The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less than in 1986 " First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter included in the annual report. "However the ultimate return to satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the successful resolution of the related problems of credit quality funding and the eventual need for substantial additional capital." First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid default. The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120 mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks. Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986 First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of 5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio. Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate prices First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs last year up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of 1986. First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986 to 1.4 billion dlrs at year-end adding that future energy chargeoffs "should be more modest." The amount represented 15 pct of First City's total loans. In real estate First City said its nonperforming assets nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end. Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs or nine pct of total loan chargeoffs and the bank said the amount could go higher. "The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio so long as the regional recession persists " First City said. "Because the carrying value of many of these loans is collateral dependent a further decline in the overall value of the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of real estate-related chargeoffs."

The company said the tender offer is the first step in a plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares. Following the tender offer Emery said it would offer 40 dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining Purolator share outstanding. On March one Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton LBO Inc a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc. Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the management-led buyout offer. In a letter to Purolator's chairman Nicholas F. Brady Emery's chairman John C. Emery said the company would still prefer to negotiate with Purolator. But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited tender offer of its own. Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on April 28 unless extended. The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan. Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations. Emery said Chemical Bank Bankers Trust Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for the tender offer. It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate payable twice a year. For the first three years after the notes are issued interest will be paid at Emery's option in cash or in additional notes Emery said. It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued. Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's management would continue with the company. "We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future " Emery's chairman said in his letter. He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast. Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for comment on the offer which was released several hours after the stock market had closed. Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8. Purolator closed at 34-7/8 off 5/8. Reuter
11773,TRAIN,true,false,COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR,Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account - declined he said without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results while the commission surplus because of the quiet stock exchange business fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986 Seipp said "we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly." He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure. The bank would as a result be more profit-oriented in future developing for example more into investment banking keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985 Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business which had soared by a quarter in 1985 rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln. As a result the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "high two-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG &lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter's majority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised as in prior years to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to problem nations was in dollars the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. "This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default " he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks he said the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America particularly from West German firms. Reuter

11863,TRAIN,false,true,U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA-WESTERN MERGER,U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> Airlines Inc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL> the Court said. O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration. A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of the injuction allowing the merger worth nearly 860 mln dlrs to go through as planned later today. The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment. The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta-based Delta which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western which has headquartera in Los Angeles. "Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight " Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night. "There was really very little that remained to be done." The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place. The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company. After learning of the appeals court ruling Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms not in new Delta outfits. Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western. The merger took place in December and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night. At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines. While all but eight pct of Western's 11 000 employees are unionized only Delta's pilots are union members. Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be "extinguished" after today.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV offer which it said it considers inadequate. The alternatives being explored include a restructuring leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another company Conrac said. Conrac which said its board discussed the alternatives at special meetings on March 26 and 30 said that its decision on whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "the future actions of Mark IV" and its unsolicitied tender offer. Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer it said. Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it becomes final the company said. The board also took other defensive steps including granting severance agreements to some officers it said. At a board meeting yesterday Concac's directors deleted a provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to remove directors without cause the company said. The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority of the company's common stock in the offer Conrac said.

12195,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC>,Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface. Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today to 40-1/8 1/4 over Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range. At least one however estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher. "They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer. Emery has shown the courage to go forth " said one arbitrager who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders. "It makes sense " said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey. But "It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a 100 pct of the synergies." Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term but long term after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets it should boost Emery's profitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX> which has 47 pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business. "This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight (delivery) business but it will not make them a power house " said Douglas Arthur of Kidder Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer. However he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator. Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth. Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr "bridge" loan that would later be replaced with other debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan. Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in revenues. Reuter

Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2. "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago and resurfaced today " one trader said. Edelman had no comment on the rumors. A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company. "There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak " analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said. Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement. The suit filed by Polaroid in April 1976 charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In October 1985 the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent the Polaroid spokesman said. Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing. Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on. "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new product spurred some speculation about their products " he said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an electronic still camera " referring to a camera that records its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

Morgan and Co Inc parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said that it will place 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil on a non-accrual basis matching similar action by BankAmerica Corp &lt;BAC> earlier today. The move which follows Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt on February 20 is expected to reduce first quarter net income by about 20 mln dlrs of which four mln dlrs represents interest accrued prior to 1987 but still uncollected the bank said. Morgan earned 233.9 mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1986. Morgan also said that based on current interest rates and assuming cash interest payments are not received for the rest of the year 1987 net income would be reduced by about 72 mln dlrs. 1986 net income was 872.5 mln dlrs. Although U.S. banks do not have to put loans on nonaccrual until they are over 90 days past due Morgan said some of the loans affected by the Brazil payment freeze may reach the 90-day limit during the second and third quarters.

12394,TRAIN,true,false,DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987,Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986 management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group which have been estimated at some one billion marks and from record profits in trading on the bank's own account not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits including own account trading rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986 and developments so far this year showed that was correct Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "other securities " to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international placement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement. Reuter

Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from Deutsche he said. He gave no details of the deal with Creditanstalt. Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of Lloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation he said. Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent capital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc> but had no plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell. &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA> in which 98.3 pct was acquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year would be consolidated this year and contribute to further expansion of Deutsche's business management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High Court Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section "participations " Christians said. But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active participation. Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations. Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in a separate holding company. Reuter
12397,TRAIN,true,false,SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH,Singapore's major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments banking sources said. The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd> &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd> &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>. The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun. Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income he said. Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System. One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore. Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate he added. Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues. Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd> a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets he said. &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd> a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm. Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns he said. Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987 helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities. They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986. Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986 economists said. The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in 1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by &lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary of the bank they said.

However the plan unveiled by senior Federation of Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe does not specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have. "The share holdings of the core companies should be equal " Watanabe said in a statement. "The actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies." He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm. "The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself " Watanabe said. Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups one of which included C and W seeking to compete against &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which now monopolizes Japan's overseas telephone business. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts. A British source who declined to be identified further said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved. C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge. The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion. "It's probably a sensible approach on their part " the British source told reuters. C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S. The proposed merger has sparked an international row with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms. The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London. The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans saying that both rival consortia should be licensed. Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms Watanabe said "They will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate." Under the Japanese law total foreign participation would be limited to one-third. "It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas " Watanabe told reporters. The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T> Mitsui and Co &lt;MITS.T> Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T> Matsushita Electric Industrial Co &lt;MC.T> Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> C Itoh and Co &lt;CITT.T> and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc>.

The company said that this was despite the mark's further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure. "The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates raw material and energy costs. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986 exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices it added. In volume terms however 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985 the company said without giving details. "The western Europe North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture especially in the case of North America " it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986 although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986 resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This combined with savings in raw material and energy costs helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas.

12443,TRAIN,false,true,COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES,&lt;San Miguel Corp> SMC and &lt;United Coconut Planters Bank> UCPB have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said. Ramon Diaz Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block held in trust by the UCPB. "It looks good " Diaz said. But he added several issues including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale. The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuango who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration. "The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers " Diaz said. "Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies." PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year. The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos. PCGG sources said SMC the Philippines' largest food and beverage manufacturer has agreed to sell 14 mln "B" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share. The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies. The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year. A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise. The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting saying the dispute was under arbitration. President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15. Eduardo de Los Angeles a government nominee in the SMC board filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating "fiduciary duty." De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan. REUTER

The issue has been taken up by the British government as a test case on the openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals said that the eight core companies of the new group should have equal share holdings but added that they could work out the precise percentages amongst themselves. The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be offered a five pct stake up from an originally proposed three pct. Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered the Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially the same. Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at 374p. REUTER

WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB down from 47.7 mln a year earlier. The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated due to changed market conditions it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively it added. WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986 up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985 bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks. Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985.

The company also said it intends to reduce its second quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts. Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 175 mln dlrs reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss reserve. It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash basis resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs. In the first quarter of 1986 Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs or 2.13 dlrs a share. Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and increased provisions address four areas of concern in the bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector developing countries some basic industrial companies and several commercial real estate businesses. Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs or about 2.5 pct of the loan book compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of total loans at the end of 1986. Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23 pct well in excess of regulatory guidelines. Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45 billion dlrs or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio compared with 928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986. Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year especially in natural gas prices it was felt prudent to increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector. "This action relates both to loans to companies directly involved in energy as well as loans to real estate developers home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern United States " Barnes said. As for LDC loans he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt. He said Mellon which was ordered in December to quit Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit lines expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts. Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter charge offs but Mellon said it remains concerned about the absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries. The increase in reserves the dividend cut and continued management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties Barnes said. "We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently trouble us will end but we are confident we are managing them aggressively " he added. Reuter

Standard Oil's nearly three billion dlrs of long-term debt is currently rated DP-5 (high A) by the ratings agency.

British Petroleum intends to fund two-thirds of that purchase with borrowed funds and the rest with cash. The additional debt will raise the fixed obligation ratio of British Petroleum from under 30 pct to perhaps 45 pct and increase its debt service requirements Duff and Phelps said. However putting Standard Oil's debt on its watch list which Duff and Phelps said had "potentially negative implications " may eventually result in an upgrade depending on how British Petroleum restructures the company Howard Mount of the ratings agency said. Mount said that acquiring Standard Oil's substantial cash flows and eliminating the annual dividend which totaled 305 mln dlrs to common shareholders in 1986 would help satisfy British Petroleum's higher debt service.

12799,TRAIN,true,false,GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS,West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks Josef Strenger a board member of the industry association VCI said. Strenger management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F> told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry which relies heavily on exports was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure after three good years neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports due to an economic revival in Japan dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year. REUTER

12827,TRAIN,false,true,TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX>,Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG> which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate analysts said. Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week but analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention. Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties which hang in regulatory limbo. Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents while its long-term debt to capital was just over 25 pct. "This gives them plenty of borrowing power " he said which could be used against an unwanted suitor. Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs. Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might launch a takeover. "I would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern " one Santa Fe executive said about Henley. "I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm strategy with Santa Fe " said Mark Hassenberg who covers Henley for DLJ Securities. Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future. These realities they said support the Henley Group's statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment. The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad. Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds. The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to merge the lines. "My guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings " Fischer said. "I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's objections " he said. "But in doing so they haven't pleased everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up." If the hearings are reopened analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say and up to another year for the ICC to decide. Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of February 1 when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding a spokesman said. Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by Norfolk Southern one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985 one analyst said. James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share buybacks from Norfolk Southern he said one of Santa Fe's options if threatened could be to buy the Henley stake. "It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a low-risk opportunistic investment " Voytko said. "People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs to 50 dlrs a share " said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. "But I'm certain that in Dingman's mind the company is worth more than that in breakup value." Reuter

12878,TRAIN,true,false,WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH,Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS> said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's guilder value van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986 was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil Taiwan Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy> taken over late last year have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986 resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover compared with 35 pct in 1982 van Driel said. The company which is already listed on the London Zurich Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in foreign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe van Driel said. REUTER

In 1986 Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share including a number of special items. Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special items and also removing the earnings of American Television and Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA> Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in 1986. Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting not directly in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest. Ted Turner Chairman would retain a 51 pct interest a Turner Broadcasting spokesman said. Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back 4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700 000 shares were purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of 81 dlrs per share. Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln shares already announced. On the subject of acquisitions Richard Munro chairman and chief executive said the company is not interested in investing in over-the-air broadcasting but continues to look at all areas in which it is currently engaged. Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time. In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman its biggest acquisition ever. N.J. Nicholas president and chief operating officer said the company might be interested in a relatively small book business. He said following the recent agreement for the sale of Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS> "there may be pieces that Murdoch doesn't want " referring to News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch. Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale Munro said it is a "delicate subject" and "we're looking at all the options." SAMI is a marketing information service for the food industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as much as 500 mln dlrs. Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added subscribers last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of 1987. However he said HBO's results in the quarter will be down slightly but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a special gain in the HBO unit. Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber growth of 800 000 for last year. He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under 50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points. Munro said the company does not plan to increase its dividend. Trygve Myhren chairman and chief executive of American Television and Communications said the unit is looking at getting involved in the home shopping video area. "It would be foolish not to be a player there " he said.

13072,TRAIN,false,true,SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES,The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination " the SEC said. Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days. Reuter

In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs. "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code " Gulf States said. The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana. "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period the company believes it could achieve financial stability " Gulf States said. In February the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas. Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief. In 1986 Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.47 billion dlrs compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year. Reuter

13263,TRAIN,true,false,CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION,Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World. Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc Caesars' financial advisor has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization. Henry Gluck chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel casino and resorts company said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff. Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer. The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday. "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years " Gluck said. He said that after the recapitalization takes effect proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs. Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding. Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992 reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization." He said the company does not usually release projections but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for among other things a "fair price" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders excluding shares held by such interested stockholders. Caesars World said in a statement that "the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit. But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements.

Hutton Group Inc EFH under which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer effective April 13. Under its merger agreement Hutton has the right to unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender offer such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for Purolator stock. Yesterday Hutton's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended its tender offer which was to have expired at midnight for two more days. It said it only about 450 000 shares or 6.5 pct of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier. Emery's bid expires April 28. Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's merger agreement PC has released Purolator from an agreement not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter into merger negotiations with it. Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares or control of the Purolator board it has agreed not to dispute PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator due to the acquisition of control by another party. The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay all of PC Acquisition's documented expenses in connection with the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so.

13904,TRAIN,true,false,WALL STREET STOCKS/MARION LABS &lt;MKC>,Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday traders and analysts said. The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago. That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987 compared to his previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company earned 70 cts a share. Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2. At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts Marion's president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of 1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to cause even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low." Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of 90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that Cardizem which treats angina is also expected to be approved for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year. Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom line." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share. "The company has a broad new product pipeline in the industry and as far as I am concerned it is the most innovative company in the business " he said. For the five years through 1991 Crossen expects Marion to have a growth rate of 55 pct. Reuter
13966,TRAIN,true,false,ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE,State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus Industrie> A340 aircraft. The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered. Last month the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd BZW sees 155 mln profit for 1987. Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings. Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards. BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion. The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971. When the government announced the sale it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company. Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit rating to match those of its main competitors such as General Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt and Whitney unit.

14843,TEST,false,true,SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER,Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank financial analysts said. Osaka-based Sumitomo with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen merged with Heiwa Sogo a small struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans in October. But despite the link-up Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position. "We'll be back in position in first place within three years " Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves. "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands " said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank but for the time being at least the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel or increase the business they do with each other. "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected " said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years not until the 21st century " Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act separates commercial from investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities. "We need to find new business chances " Komatsu said. "In some cases these will be securities related in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want." Until such changes occur Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd in which it holds a five pct share Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary. "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years " he said. Like other city banks Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies " said Kleinwort's Smithson. "After that it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong." REUTER

It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986 compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985. The company said it had been able to cut its losses because its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu started in the second half of 1986. Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their restructuring into a gold loan. A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of 275 mln dlrs to be repaid by the mining company in gold.

Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told Reuters Citibank one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices. Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985. Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's second-hand securities and equities markets to be approved later this spring and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year. Citibank lost 490 000 crowns in Norway in 1985 but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.

14911,TEST,true,false,JARDINE MATHESON REPLACES "B" SHARE BY BONUS ISSUE,Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd &lt;JARD.HK> said it will withdraw the previously announced four-for-one bonus issue of "B" shares and replace it by a two-for-five bonus issue of ordinary shares. A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded capital. Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and Securities Commissioner Ray Astin that the listings of new "B" shares would be barred. The official announcement said this will include the proposal by Jardine Matheson. But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying: "We continue to believe that the issuing of "B" shares would benefit shareholders and regret that they will not be given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage." Keswick said the "B" share issue will benefit Jardine Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting existing shareholders' voting rights. However he added: "We certainly welcome (the Secretary for Monetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the development of general principles which can be embraced by all constituents of the Hong Kong market."

14921,TEST,false,true,SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS,A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN> to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said. A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares which represent 31 pct of SMC's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's plans to sell the shares to SMC were "a serious breach of fiduciary duties." The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles a government nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles who represents SMC's minority stockholders asked the SEC to block the transaction approved last week by the company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15. "The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares " San Miguel Corp said in a statement. "Coming as it does when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15 " the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco's court petition adding: "Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial." Meanwhile Ramon Diaz the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "A" shares which can only be owned by Filipinos and 14 mln "B" shares which are available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies SMC Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June. "We have no objection to Soriano buying the "B" shares " Diaz told Reuters. "But everything is on hold now." The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders' meeting scheduled for May 14. San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos an increase of about 50 pct over 1985. REUTER

14982,TEST,false,true,PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION,Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure would be fairer to all shareholders and would insure that takeovers are properly financed " he said. Among the provisions the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days Proxmire said. In addition there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it " Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year. Reuter

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 22. U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987." Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987 Bankers Trust estimated that full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs. Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments. The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

15063,TEST,true,true,ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY,Cheap oil feedstocks the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp &lt;GAF> privately-held Cain Chemical Inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH> the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period " said Paul Oreffice chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> adding "There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones." Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said John Dosher managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said. Oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it " Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK> recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR> a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated " Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market." Some top chemical executives share the concern. "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes " GAF's Heyman cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long." Houston-based Cain Chemical created this month by the Sterling investment banking group believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high-margin business " Cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth. Reuter

"As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned they are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors " spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query. "All the information that has been given out publicly is that yes Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors " he said. Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment. Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition. Dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them. Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer. Dominion Textile which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.

15103,TEST,true,false,J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL  TRADING,J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest payments on February 20 reduced the quarter's net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986 Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income mainly fees and commissions rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter down from 499.4 mln a year earlier and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses Morgan's allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil non-accruing loans at quarter's end were 583 mln dlrs down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs with more than half the increase related to personnel costs Morgan said. Reuter

Edelman would not comment and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors." Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion however added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington was among them. "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning they've done " said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations which made sheets and other linens to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition Gormley said. "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer " said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics Burlington bought C.H. Masland which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry. "In the past they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make " she said. "You look at their record over the year and I think they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past " Gormley said. She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share up from 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis. Some arbitragers however said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history a lot of people don't find him very credible anymore " said one arbitrager. Another however said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn't win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington. J.P.

15194,TEST,true,false,HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS  WIDER PENETRATION,Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986 despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration. Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company Europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986 said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S. Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand and in Europe where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies rose by 4.4 pct to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct new ventures and modernization particularly in French and Spanish interests eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year Heineken said adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We have the beer but distribution and sales is the important point " van Schaik said adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market but how we are to do it " van Schaik said adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer the internal structure was very regionalized. Heineken board member Hans Coebergh responsible for African operations said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term. He said the company present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25 was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum which had sold successfully Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor " Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales but the bars only accept western money. Reuter

At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the year ending April 30 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs or about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs. In the year ago period the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs or 3.65 dlrs a share on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs. Winston Wallin Medtronic chairman said the company will improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line. Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988. He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends or share repurchases " he said. Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988 from 40 pct in fiscal 1987. He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic products which includes pacemakers valves catheters and lasers will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will double that by 1995. Wallin said "Our objective is to get a hold of new products and start building market share if we have to beg borrow or steal to get into new markets." In the past Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators also have criticized the industry citing quality problems and a needless overprescription of pacemakers. "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our pacemakers or leads " Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish our company as the quality leader in the industry." Glen Nelson executive vice president for Medtronics said the company intends to diversify internally and through acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise such as drug delivery systems. Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions from an acquisition." Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988. The company markets Activitrax the first single chamber pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical activity. Siemens AG a West German company is also developing a rate responsive pacemaker. Reuter

Kell Houssels III told Reuters. He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of its recently-opened Atlantic City N.J. Showboat Hotel Casino and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well. But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988 should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the contribution of the new Atlantic City facility. Showboat earned 1 753 000 dlrs in last year's third quarter. For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5 769 000 dlrs. Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic City hotel/casino Showboat has had to start charging interest expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest as it had been able to do previously. Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming was completed earlier in the week. Reuter

Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs per share reported for the first quarter of 1986. The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador. Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. Ecuador which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion dlrs has not paid any interest to foreign banks since February. In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted the export of oil which accounts for about 75 pct the country's export revenues. In its announcement Security Pacific said it will record interest income only as it is received in cash. The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume later in 1987. The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

In its newly released annual report Union Texas said it replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of 27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves. Union Texas the nation's largest independent oil and gas producer based on revenues is a privately-held company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>. The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on 1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year compared to profits of 165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985. Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom Indonesia and Pakistan. In the United States Union Texas said it completed evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta area. "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed development of this discovery will not be economical without substantially higher prices " the company said. Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in the Gulf of Mexico.

15239,TEST,false,true,UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY,UAL Inc may have a response this afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United Airlines unit a UAL spokesman said. "Obviously we have a lot of movement in our stock and we need to get a clarification out " the spokesman said adding that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released today. The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for 2.3 billion dlrs and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt. Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer Donald Trump held a position in its stock and that he also held discussions with its chairman. The developer indicated in those talks that he took the position as an investment but he revealed no other plans. Today rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2 mln shares. "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL management " said Timothy Pettee Bear Stearns and co analyst. Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz rental cars Westin and Hilton International hotels in a strategy to become a travel service company. The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline. UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to Allegis as of May one. But takeover speculation has escalated and Wall Street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100 dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as widespread indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play. Market sources have said that although Trump attracted attention to the stock the pilots proposal acted as a catalyst kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer. "The first domino is you have an investor with a considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past " said Pettee. "What's interesting is the values are there. There's something for everybody " he said. Reuter

The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on March nine set April nine as the target date for completing negotiations. However the letter also allowed room for an extension of that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached. The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by April 23." Chrysler and Renault said "Given the complex nature of the deal the need for additional time was to be expected." The March letter of intent between the two companies says that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date "in the event that prior to April 9 1987 Chrysler discovers an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence' investigation of the company " referring to American Motors. A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's statement that more time was needed because the talks are complex.

15263,TEST,true,false,GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE> 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA,General Electric Corp said its first quarter results were significantly higher due to the strong results of RCA which was acquired last year. General Electric also attibuted continued strong performances in plastics major appliances and the Employers Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter. GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624 mln dlrs or 1.37 dls per shr up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs or 1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago. General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results are in line with those expectations. General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and station operations of the National Broadcasting Co which was not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986 as one reason for its strong earnings. It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was much higher than a year ago caused by a increase in shipments than the 1986 quarter which was impacted by a strike. Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first quarter from a year ago mainly because of the inclusion of RCA's aerospace and defense business the company said. In addition consumer products revenues were up from last year mainly because of including sales of RCA video products. General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after taxes from an inventory accounting change.

"They were very frustrated with their inability to get Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one " said Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co. American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to buy the company. But since then Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco. "This is just typical " said George Thompson of Prudential-Bache securities. "There's going to be more to come here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds " he said. cash flow from its low growth tobacco but the tobacco business does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can therefore use its funds to make acquisitions.

15372,TEST,false,true,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY,Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with political analysts said. MPT thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians they said. "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector telecommunications and information " said one diplomatic source. "They are a potent political force " the diplomatic source said. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy analysts said. "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized " said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation." Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd which now monopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London which has threatened to retaliate and Washington which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates. "What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place " said James Abegglen head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority analysts said. "With the legal framework eased they became the de facto legal framework " said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence the analysts said. "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s) but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT " Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100 000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits a key element in financial liberalisation since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks they said. Diplomatic sources frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture have characterized the ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain several analysts said. "The United States is really the odd man out " Abegglen said. "For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view " he said.

The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured by falls in exchange rates particularly in the US and Australian dollar and sterling. Without these currency fluctuations net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher NatNed said. The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986 compared with 52 pct in 1985. The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences tighter interest margins and increased investment.

Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986 mainly due to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher being the lower dollar rate high initial costs for new products and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague. In 1986 a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S. AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986 saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group's profits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp. AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986 against 3.46 billion the year before. REUTER

15581,TEST,true,false,VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES,Losses for Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> VW linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made a VW spokesman said. The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit." VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company. VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985 since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985 VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks. REUTER

It said its subsidiaries which account for 96 pct of its 32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property plant and equipment were free of the action. Only parent holding company Texaco Inc and operating subsidiaries Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V are affected it said. But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs. Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>. Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985 judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost matches the damages awarded against Texaco. Should Texaco fail to place the bond Pennzoil could begin to attach its assets to secure the judgment. Last Monday the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs and sent the issue back to the Texas courts. Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of the Pennzoil lawsuit. "Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed " James Kinnear Texaco's president and chief executive officer told reporters. Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of April pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11. Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not sell any assets Kinnear said. Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under 11.1 billion dlrs he added. Joseph Jamail a Houston attorney for Pennzoil said the company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for bankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies. "Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court " Jamail said. Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals adding that Texaco's assets were ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full. REUTER

16130,TEST,false,true,OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS,A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1 1987 when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt restructuring " oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations " said Wilf Gobert an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring he added. "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome) " Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to us in our discussions it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward " he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer. REUTER

16163,TEST,false,true,BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM,Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp facing an unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF> agreed to a 4.23 billion dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc>. Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a definitive merger agreement under which a subsidiary of the new company &lt;AV Holdings Corp> will begin a 48.50 dlr per share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of Borg-Warner common stock. The offer will be followed by a merger in which each remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and 54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated discount debentures. As a result of the merger Borg-Warner will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction but they will retain their positions with the company. A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares. GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share. Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit which includes Wells Fargo security guards and the Chilton Corp a credit rating service. Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the stock. Following the GAF offer analysts had calculated breakup values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and speculated an offer would have to be sweetened. In its statement Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its advisors First Boston Corp and Goldman Sachs and Co. James Burke president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners said "We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its strong presence in the Chicago community." Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT May 9) subject to conditions including the completion of necessary financing arrangements. The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares or 51 pct of the outstanding shares being tendered. Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments. Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the financing required to complete the transaction. The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying cash interest after five years. The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option for the first six years at 105 pct during the seventh year at 102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount. The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before maturity. Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50 dlrs cumulative preferred stock series A for 100 dlrs per share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock. The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right effective immediately. REUTER

Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N> &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd> which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>. Along with the TransCanada offer Dome has had another proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer Dome said in a statement. The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid but did not identify the companies involved in talks. TransCanada Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator said it is offering Dome a package of cash common and preferred shares and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management not to shareholders. Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs. Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals. It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments." But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals. TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome's statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal it had a legal obligation to announce it " he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders or the terms of other offers. Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at 5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981. REUTER

16215,TEST,false,true,OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS,A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1 1987 when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations. TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt restructuring " oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations " said Wilf Gobert an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring he added. "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome) " Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to us in our discussions it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward " he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals including TransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer. Reuter
16216,TEST,false,true,SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>,Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned. In a newspaper advertisement Sosnoff said the bid by his MTS Acquisition Corp withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March Sosnoff said he had received a "negligible" number of shares in response to the offer which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln common shares now outstanding or a 13.3 pct interest on a primary basis. Last week Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share subject to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in June. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing as well as to approvals by New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a merger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares he is now seeking together with the 4 217 675 shares he owns would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a "negligible" number of shares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in the statement Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused on April 8 to meet with him even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding Corp an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM> which leads a syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr margin facility believes it will be able to arrange for further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the purchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender each of the 2 750 000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis would be converted into Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm. He said "To the extent that fewer than 29 100 000 sdhares are purchased in the offer the stockholders would receive a combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars." Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to Caesars' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval a process that it already underway in New Jersey. He said his offer has been extended based on the likely duration of the regulatory process. He said he intends to further extend the offer if the approval process is not completed by the expiration date. Reuter

Foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" is about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net after tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over a period of several years and continuing through part of the first quarter of 1987."

16367,TEST,true,false,CHEMICAL &lt;CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL  EXPENSES,Chemical New York Corp said its first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct largely because it placed 1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual. Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln dlrs down from 102.6 mln a year earlier but declaring the Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in lost interest income or 12 mln dlrs after-tax. A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in consumer capital markets and investment banking activities. Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs or 4.3 pct below 1986 earnings. Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not resumed by year's end Chemical said its after-tax net for the whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs. Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest income by 1.5 mln dlrs. Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from 3.96 pct. This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans a reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's cost of funds. Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from 27.0 mln but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs from 26.2 mln. Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5 mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier Chemical said. The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs compared with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln up from 60.7 mln leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at quarter's end or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding compared with 594.3 mln or 1.50 pct a year earlier. Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil) compared with 1.35 billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of March 1986. Reuter

16399,TEST,true,false,NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES,National Westminster Bank USA said higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported a year earlier. The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual. Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with 91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans mostly to middle market businesses increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates. Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0 mln a year earlier. At March 31 the allowance for loan losses was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986. Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the end of the first quarter of 1986 largely because 119 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status. The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

16430,TEST,true,false,TALKING POINT/IBM &lt;IBM>,International Business Machines Corp has started the year aggressively but industry analysts said the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop a two-year earnings slump. "I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I have been in a long time " said PaineWebber analyst Stephen Smith. "But they're not out of the woods yet " he added. At 1.30 dlrs a share IBM's first-quarter net income easily topped most estimates on Wall Street which had ranged from an even dollar to 1.20 dlrs. Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be felt until later in the year. These include the success of IBM's new personal computer line introduced two weeks ago and its 9370 minicomputers which will begin volume shipments in July. In addition IBM has said the full benefits of its early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will emerge as the year progresses. Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than he has been for nearly a year. "Although the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled there are some encouraging signs in our business " Akers said pointing to among other things higher first-quarter shipments. "We remain optimistic about the prospects for both the industry and IBM " he said. "Akers was most encouraging " said PaineWebber's Smith. A weak dollar a lower tax rate and strong mainframe computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected first-quarter results analysts said. "Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in March " after a weak January and February said Ulric Weil of Washington-based Weil and Associates. Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes commonly called the Sierras "bailed out the whole quarter " Weil said adding "If this continues it augers well for the rest of the year." REUTER...^M

16434,TEST,true,false,IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL,Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status. Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62. Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual reducing first-quarter net income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax. Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on these loans during the remainder of 1987. Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses although these were partly offset by increased trust income profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities gains the bank said. The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs up from 185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was 21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986. Reuter

Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at 1.50 dlrs per share up 37 cts.

This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT> in July 1986. Under the joint venture each company owns 50 pct of Sprint. Earlier the company reported net income declined to 265.0 mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago. Theodore Brophy chairman of GTE said "we expect US Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance telecommunications. The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as well as higher operating costs related in part to the fraudalent use of the network. Operating income of its telephone operations which account for 91 pct of the total rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs. Revenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9 billion dlrs. Reuter

In the same year-ago period Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a share from continuing operations. Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit. Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara Calif. to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves would not be sold separately from the pipeline. Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for Celeron was too high Mercer said "There is no fire sale going on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable operation throughout the year." Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover bid. Reuter

16513,TEST,false,true,GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID,GAF Corp set on acquiring Borg-Warner Corp's valuable plastics business is believed by analysts to be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company. Yesterday Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for 4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for 89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock and a package of cash and securities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in with another bid " said one analyst who values the company at 51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's stock. "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up the price. Obviously nobody wants to pay more than you have to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking at it - that it's worth more " Pershing and Co analyst Richard Henderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill Lynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as telephones computer terminals and appliances. "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical operation these days " said Henderson. "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter and he does not like to get pushed around " said Henderson. GAF a roofing and chemicals concern attempted a takeover of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF did not win the company it made a substantial gain on its investment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer and does not succeed a higher bid from another company would give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. "It's a win-win situation " said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be forthcoming shortly. "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this book " he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts protective services which includes Wells Fargo security guards and Chilton Corp a credit rating service. Charles Rose an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows GAF said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer it would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit or about 3.50 per share. "I think there's a probability he goes up in price " said Rose. Rose said however he could not really predict what Heyman would do. "Sam's a low-risk high-return player." "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical enterprise or is he trying to be an investment bank " Rose said. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add earnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as 50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time if they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities " said John Henry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986 operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs and net earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986. "The Borg chemical business is great " said Rose adding its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>. Reuter

16680,TEST,false,true,DOME &lt;DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION,Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the debt-heavy company. Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock Exchange where it was the most active stock. It rose as high as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months Dome has normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets but Dome which is based in Calgary Alberta said it is also still talking with two other companies which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed to be foreign oil companies noting that TransCanada yesterday stressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financial difficulties of Dome Petroleum." "The talk is about Conoco which is controlled by DuPont &lt;DD> and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> which sold its Canadian interest in 1975 and could be getting back in " said Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer despite BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks with Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield British Petroleum Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfully optimistic " given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome shareholders stock in a new subsidiary which it valued at 1.10 dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer current Dome common and preferred shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary which would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada would own 80 pct. However Bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "The TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome " he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at the upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome." The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87 billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs) with another one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand. "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs so on that basis the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that " Gobert said. Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta the heart of Canada's oil industry. Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of land across Canada. The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of 2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.) believed to be the largest ever by a Canadian company. Reuter

16727,TEST,false,true,MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG &lt;BOR> DEAL,Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER> subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts whether or not the deal which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs succeeds. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30 mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed. But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln dlrs if the deal fails for reasons which include another party holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct. The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any tender offer agreement either in compensation for dealer manager services or for break-up of the deal. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets backed by a group of investors it organized has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock. The company's board has approved the plan which was intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp. Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a share exercise price before the merger is effective it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time Merrill Lynch told the company it would consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities if the Borg-Warner board approved it said. On Feb 24 it said it was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a share proposal on March 31 Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it was conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees Merrill Lynch said it will also get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in the tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their positions. But for flexibility purposes Merrill Lynch said it is considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130 mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt of Borg-Warner Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal Merrill Lynch said it expects to borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln dlrs of common stock of the new company sell 100 mln dlrs of non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch and Co sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of subordinated discount debentures. GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash. Reuter

16833,TEST,false,true,AMOCO &lt;AN> MAY BUY DOME &lt;DMP>  REPORT SAYS,Amoco Corp is apparently the successful bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd according to a published report. The Toronto Globe and Mail quoting sources close to the negotiations today said Dome broke off talks last night with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd which last week announced a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were available and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco had emerged the winner the newspaper said. However the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome could be finalized and announced this weekend the Globe and Mail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Last Sunday when TransCanada announced its offer Dome said it was also in talks with two other companies but refused to identify them. Since then market speculation has centered on Amoco and Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in Canada. British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days Dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic analysts and officials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run afoul of Canadian antitrust laws however TransCanada is asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp. Reuter

16995,TEST,false,true,SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS INDIANA TAKEOVER LAW,The Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision ruled that an Indiana law aimed at protecting companies from hostile takeovers by out-of-state businesses is constitutional. The high court justices reversed a ruling by a U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago that struck down the 1986 control-share acquisition law. The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corp of America against CTS Corp based in Elkhart Ind. Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million shares to bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company's total. After CTS invoked the state law Dynamics filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the measure. One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on the tender offer at the option of the target company. It also requires that the acquisition for control shares in an Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless a majority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at their next regularly scheduled meeting. Justice Lewis Powell writing for the court majority held that the state law was not pre-empted by federal securities law. "The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from the coercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as a group " he said. He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offers and may decrease the number of successful tender offers for Indiana corporations. But he said the law does not discriminate against interstate commerce and was justified by the state's interests in protecting shareholders. Reuter
16998,TEST,false,true,FALCONBRIDGE &lt;FALCF.O> SEES IMPROVED RESULTS,Falconbridge Ltd said it expected results for the rest of 1987 to improve from the earlier reported first quarter operating loss of 15.4 mln dlrs. Chief executive William James told reporters after the annual meeting that "I would hope that the loss for the year certainly wouldn't be a high as the loss for the first quarter. In other words we are going to make money from here on in." Falconbridge last year made a first quarter operating loss of 17.1 mln dlrs and a full-year operating loss of 15.5 mln dlrs. James said currency losses tied to the stronger Canadian dollar resulted for about eight mln dlrs of the first quarter operating loss. Falconbridge records its cash and accounts receivable in U.S. dollars with the Canadian dollar equivalent decreasing as the U.S. dollar falls. He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weaker nickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at the company's Sudbury Ontario nickel operations and at some Kidd Creek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher production through the rest of the year and higher average prices this year for precious metals James added without elaborating. Falconbridge has no immediate plans for further divestments James said in reply to reporters' inquiries. The company sold several mining subsidiaries last year to help pay down debt from its January 1986 acquisition of Kidd Creek Mines Ltd from Canada Development Corp &lt;CDC.TO>. He said Falconbridge's debt now totaled about one billion dlrs down from 1.37 billion dlrs at the time of the Kidd Creek buy. James said he could not assess the impact of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>'s proposed acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>. Dome's 23 pct-owned Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> owns 21 pct of Falconbridge. Asked by reporters if Falconbridge preferred competing Dome bidder Calgary Alberta-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd to Chicago-based Amoco James replied "It makes no difference to me...whoever takes it over is fine by us." He told shareholders that Falconbridges' planned capital expenditures this year would decline to 134 mln dlrs from 160 mln dlrs last year. Reuter

A report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) late last night said TransCanada's new bid was rejected by Dome which has accepted a 5.1 billion dlr bid from Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. "We still want to acquire Dome's assets and are prepared to negotiate. However we have not presented a new proposal to the company since April 16 and Dome has refused to negotiate with TransCanada since that date " said TransCanada president Gerald Maier. TransCanada said its proposal consists of two parts -- 4.5 billion dlrs in cash and securities and one billion dlrs of payments to creditors based on future profits. Last week TransCanada valued the first part of its offer at 4.3 billion dlrs but a spokesman today said the company increased the estimated value of that part to 4.5 billion dlrs after the recent gain in Dome's stock. Dome was halted today on the Toronto Stock Exchange pending clarification of TransCanada's offer. It last traded at 1.70 dlrs per share. Two weeks ago before TransCanada's offer Dome traded at about 1.10 dlrs per share. Reuter
17004,TEST,false,true,SORO GROUP TO LIMIT FAIRCHILD &lt;FEN> STOCK BUYS,Quantum Fund N.V. a Netherlands Antilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Soros is investment adviser said it has agreed to limit further purchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Quantum which already holds 1 647 481 Fairchild common shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding said it agreed to the restriction after Fairchild said its security clearance might be jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it. But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros acting either individually or through entities other than Quantum that he controls may decide to buy common stock in the company on his own behalf. Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock. Unless the FTC had objected Quantum would have been free but not obligated to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock. Fairchild management however warned that if Quantum a foreign entity raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct it could "impair" the government security clearances Fairchild needs to carry out its its defense contract work. In response Quantum said it told Fairchild it will not make "significant additional purchases" of its common or preferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice to enable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action. Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification request to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild. Quantum also said it told the FTC and the Justice Department that it does not expect to resubmit any further notifications of intent to significantly raise its stake in Fairchild at this time. The restrictions Quantum has agreed to follow regarding further dealings in Fairchild stock do not apply to Soros as an individual investor.

Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to consider at a later stage an increase in CSR's Monier stake to enable it to become a CSR subsidiary assuming Redland exercises the second option CSR said.

"The acquisition will broaden CSR interests in building materials by the addition of complementary domestic and overseas businesses in concrete and clay tiles metal roofing materials and concrete blocks and piping " Kelman said in the statement. "Importantly the acquisition will provide CSR with new growth opportunities in building materials both in Australia and overseas " he added.

The suit filed in Manhattan also names First Boston Corp &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40 000 shares of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with 4 700 000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan. The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have 8 160 000 votes. The suit brought derivatively on behalf of Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent conveyance. The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose that one consequence of the payment of the dividend which it terms illegal will be that shareholders will be liable to repay it. Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the recapitalizaton plan. At the time it said it was reviewing its alternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date. British Printing holds 460 600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs worth of debentures. The suit also alleges that management the board of directors and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured.

17700,TEST,false,true,COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM,Computer Associates International Inc's 800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its strongest rival but the company still faces stiff competition from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> Wall Street analysts said. "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems software " said Scott Smith an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette. "But the combination of the two companies will clearly present a much stronger front " he said. Besides IBM "Computer Associates will be far and away the most powerful company in the field " added E.F. Hutton analyst Terence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as system utilities or software packages that boost the productivity of a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM. Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that will find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates the merger with Uccel caps a six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August the company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent software vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang took the company public in 1981 and since then he has bought 15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3 mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly sold off its non-computer businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe computer software. In 1984 the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt who said he will leave the company after the merger is completed also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986 Uccel completed the buyouts of six companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986 it earned 17.0 mln dlrs or 1.01 dlrs a share on sales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the dark days of 1982 when as Wyly Corp it lost 7.7 mln dlrs or 56 cts a share. At that time Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different businesses only three of which were involved in computer software. In 1983 Walter Haefner a Swiss financier and a major Wyly investor lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services unit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a news conference that the merger would give computer users a single source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities Computer Associates also sell products for microcomputers while Uccel has made inroads in the applications software market where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and enhance both companies' product lines but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05 dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales marketing and research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel. Based on Friday's closing price the company will swap 47.50 dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share which is nearly 33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most software companies are currently valued at about 20 times per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner the Swiss investor would hold about 25 pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently owns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department. Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the merger but he did not rule out working together with Wang. Reuter

Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the company this morning. The company said it is evaluating both proposals. Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment. Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and "we may add a bank to that." "We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign " he said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock. Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group which the company did not identify topped his offer between now and the board meeting Bilzerian said he expected an opportunity to respond. Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group but did say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement regarding management's equity participation. Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management particpation was "nominal." Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs. "We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22 dlrs " said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for 17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct cumulative preferred stock. Robert Cheadle analyst at Montgomery Securities said "you have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid." Scott Drysdale analyst at Birr Wilson Securities said the company has not made the best strategic moves over the years. "They have not done the right things at the right time " he said and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln dlrs. Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people than many competitors but it competes on price even though competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins. He noted that there have been no other publicly identified bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier Bilzerian proposal in mid-April. Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and Bilzerian's plan. Reuter

17812,TEST,false,true,USPCI &lt;UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID,share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP) analysts said. "The offer is inadequate " said Douglas Augenthaler an analyst with E.F. Hutton noting that it does not represent the needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on earnings estimates. USPCI which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding was trading at 48-1/8 down 3/8. USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board would meet to consider it. Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34 dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid its announcement that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price USPCI could maintain a stock price in the low 40s Augenthaler said. Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the announcment he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90 dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs. In addition analysts said the hazardous waste management business holds significant growth potential. The industry has grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years based on earnings per share said Jeffrey Klein an analyst with Kidder Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at 15 to 35 pct over the next five years he said. Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer or 375 mln dlrs total would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable business and win cost-control benefits he said. "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly signficant environmmental problems of its own " he said. Herb Mee Jr. president of Beard Oil Co (BEC) which holds a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI said last week Union Pacific's offer was "grossly inadequate." Reuter

In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission the Edelman/Dominion group known as Samjens Acqusition Corp said it sold options to buy 258 800 Burlington common shares reducing its stake in the company to 3 408 813 shares or 12.33 pct from 3 667 313 shares or 13.3 pct. The group said the sale which represented all the Burlington options it owned was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs. The Edelman/Dominion group last week sweetened its hostile tender offer to 77 dlrs a share after Burlington agreed to a leveraged buyout by a Morgan Stanley and Co-backed group for 76 dlrs a share.

17839,TEST,false,true,ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER,A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy> the leading New York City electronics retailer or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid. The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em> for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986 may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics the nation's biggest at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. "I have mixed feelings " said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler Geurin and Turner a Dallas brokerage. "On the one hand it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?" "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing " said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson a Minneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in place." Laurence said that since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20 rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading. Antar the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City Philadelphia and Connecticut areas said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other often discounted electronics goods to retailers primarily in the southwest and directly to consumers by cable television. In fiscal 1986 ending last January its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750 000 dlrs in 1985. Entertainment Marketing whose chief executive officer Elias Zinn once ran an electronics retailing business said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance. Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount. Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50. Reuter

17849,TEST,false,true,INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC,The investor group that has agreed to buy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal computer retailer public or sell it to other investors industry analysts said. "Now's a good time " said Joe Levy of International Data Corp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is on the way up again " he said. Earlier today closely held Computerland the largest PC retailing chain in the country said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co New York. Neither Computerland which is 96 pct owned by its founder William H. Millard nor E.M. Warburg a money management and venture capital firm would disclose the value of the transaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year would fetch 150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment. E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds and its past investments have included Mattel Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager with 3.5 billion dlrs under management. Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack stores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces customer service and customer support " said Levy of International Data. Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985. Ed Faber who took over as chairman and chief executive officer revamped the company's royalty plan which help quell much of the franchisee dissent. Reuter

17863,TEST,false,true,BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW,U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for Burlington the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for Burlington and Samjens a partnership formed by Dominion Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until the case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS> one dlr per share lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens offer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt. That information Burlington said was provided by James Ammeen a former Burlington executive through PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen who had worked for Burlington for 23 years had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November 1985 Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to "takeover the company dismember the company and displace its management " Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from PaineWebber but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or Burlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went public April 24 with their intention to take over the company. Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in February. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and dominion with a written statement that they did not provide inside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an effort to takeover Burlilgnton. "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an American company " said burlington lawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington as the largest manufacturer of denim in the United States would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion Canada's largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants in Georgia which would reduce competition in the denim market the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by Burlington in Canada in which it said it was considering a bid for Dominion. "Surely what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander " said Sidney Rosdeitcher a Samjens lawyer. Reuter

The holders none of whom was willing to be identified said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares to common stock by the June eight record date for a special dividend they were unable to determine if it might be better for them to continue holding the debentures. "There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation if we don't get answers " said a Wall Street source.

Harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock in the recapitalized firm. The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share. Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.

Alternatively ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share it said in a statement. As previously reported ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday. It now holds 14.99 pct the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base. The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs against 593 mln for the CSR bid. Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31. ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances. ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment. ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim he added. Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid. He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids. As previously reported the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L> which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing. CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture. CSR officials have also said they had no intention of raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention became public last week. REUTER
17886,TEST,false,true,JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS,Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups industry sources said. They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). A spokesman for a major firm said "Deregulation would bring about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer competition we have no choice but to accept it." The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12. The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day about 75 pct of current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output and oil tariffs should be abolished. They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency and most saw it as inevitable. "Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn to see if we can survive cut-throat competition " said a source at one major Japanese oil company. A spokesman for a smaller refiner said "We'll have a hard time surviving but that's something we must go through." "In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies " he said. Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985 cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986. Cosmo Oil Co Ltd the third largest seller of oil products in 1985 cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year a spokesman for the company said. Between 1984 and 1986 on the recommendation of the Council 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry. Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups. "MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles " a source said. A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls. He declined to officially confirm or deny that the Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards deregulation. REUTER

Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible. Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche made losses in 1985 and 1986 the 20 pct stake was obtained at below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum. The Europeesche which specialises in travel and recreation insurance had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986. Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion guilders making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer. Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985 which narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986 van Leeuwen said. He said the company was on course for independent recovery and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987. REUTER

17986,TEST,false,true,CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER,CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters. ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's issued capital of 156.28 mln shares plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed bid. The proposed offer by ETL controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days. Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L> which holds just under 50 pct of Monier still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S. Where Monier has built up a strong presence notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option. ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier beyond describing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials Herbert said. "We fit better with Monier " he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve Herbert said: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target." Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50 or 16.8 times earnings in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today down 25 cents on yesterday after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares. ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason they did not think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands. "Redland is still in the driving seat " said Tim Cohen of &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd> adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL. Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid. REUTER

18071,TEST,false,true,JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS,U.S. District Court Judge Eugene A. Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by Samjens Acquisition Corp. "I do not know how I come down on this preliminary injunction " Gordon said after listening to arguments by attorneys for 1-1/2 days. "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much information as I have been. I have to consider what's been presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be winners " he said. Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover effort by Samjens claiming the partnership used illegally obtained confidential information about the company to make its offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if Samjens formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada were to succeed. Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share. Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid 72 dlrs per share for Burlington. Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would "kill the offer" Jay Greenfield an attorney for Samjens said the partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted. "There's only one Burlington " he said. "If we cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us." Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not in this for the money " he said. Irving Nathan a Burlington lawyer reiterated that information provided by James Ammeen a former Burlington executive was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o takeover of Burlington. "Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider Jim Ammeen " Nathan said. An attorney for Ammeen who is named as a defendant asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client.

An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit. The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale. Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in Vancouver Calgary Ottawa and Toronto and 100 pct interest in Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60 pct of the Westin in Edmonton. Richard Ferris chairman of Allegis said in a statement the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert unrecognized asset appreciation into cash. As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership the money will be used for general corporate needs the spokesman said. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead underwriters for to the public offering. The limited partnership will be offered outside the U.S Allegis said. Reuter

18138,TEST,false,true,SPECTRA-PHYSICS &lt;SPY> MULLS SALE  RESTRUCTURE,Spectra-Physics Inc said it is considering the possibility of recapitalizing restructuring or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the San Jose Calif. gas lasers and accessories company also said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base salary if they stay with the company through August 29. In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG the company said it was unfair. The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously with two Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating to reject the Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid citing an opinion from its financial advsior Morgan Stanley and Co Inc that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares " the company said. The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan Stanley to "vigorously investigate pursue and authorize any alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders' investment in the company " the company said. Among the alternatives the special committee will consider are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32 dlrs a share a recapitalization or restructuring including self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of dividends Spectra-Physics said. The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay an average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary it said. Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in order to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the (Ciba-Geigy) offer." Under the plan the executives would be entitled to their cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29 but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons other than gross and willful misconduct or if they leave the company because their salaries have been sharply cut. Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington Del. charging it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in violation of securities law and with violating the intent of July 9 1985 standstill agreement. Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20 pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat. Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance Group Holdings &lt;REL> which is controlled by New York investor Saul Steinberg controls 12.8 pct. Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1 1992 unless another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power. Reuter

Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag Black said "That would not be wildly inaccurate " although he declined to disclose the actual cost. Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper group with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec City Ottawa and Chicoutimi Quebec and four printing plants in Ontario and Quebec. Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25 000 readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10 such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23 dailies. "There is really no end to the ones that are available " he told reporters although he added that most remaining acquisition opportunities are in the U.S. He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC of London should become profitable in this year's fourth quarter. For full-year 1987 the Daily Telegraph could break even or better said Black citing major reductions in labor costs and improved technology at the Telegraph Britain's largest circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian dlrs last year. Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily circulation had risen by 25 000 since September to about 1 150 000 on weekdays despite added competition from the new Independent daily newspaper. Knight said The Independent was not affecting the Telegraph's growth but was making inroads into the circulation of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The Guardian. Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post 1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs or one dlr a share including extraordinary gains from previous sales of discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.

18317,TEST,false,true,PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION,Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert Durham said the company is prepared to make another large non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the near future. In an interview with Reuters Durham said the company was examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. He declined to name the companies but said a deal could occur as soon as the second half of 1987. Phelps Dodge which ranks as the largest copper producer in the U.S. last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires among other products. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper operations. Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to buy another non-copper company Durham said citing about 100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit. Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different economic cycle than copper substantial earnings and good management he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly deal he added. "We're not talking high-tech or financial services or about a perfume company " he said. "We want a good basic industrial company that will fit into our management structure " Durham said. During the interview Durham and other executives also said continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to higher prices for the metal. "In my view it's not a matter of if but when the price (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new projects coming on and demand short of a major recession will continue to grow modestly " said executive vice president Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of producing copper the executives said. Costs should be below 50 cents a pound after depreciation but before interest and corporate expense by 1989 or 1990. Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now compared to one dlr a pound in 1981 some Wall St analysts said. Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong. He declined to project results for the second quarter or year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in copper prices in the last month will help results. Durham said last month that the second quarter should match the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln dlrs or 49 cts a share. First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico also acquired last year. Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75 dlrs a share up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986. Reuter

18688,TEST,false,true,ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS,Atlantic Richfield Co considering a spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations could gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal industry analysts estimated. Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on about 183 mln outstanding shares the market in its frenzy was valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs analysts said. Atlantic Richfield aware of the rumors issued a statement around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of the unit leading investors to take profits. After the announcement the company's stock retreated closing at 93-7/8 up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4. "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat disappointing " said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He said rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple of days." Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought and its value was not reflected in the company's stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about three billion dlrs putting the 20 pct interest at around 500 to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake because chemical margins had peaked and he speculated the company would use the proceeds to pay down debt. But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall through. Yesterday ARCO said the proposal had not yet been presented to its board. The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion dlrs. Reuter

18938,TEST,false,true,GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR,Ronald Perelman head of Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV> may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette Co that could draw some big international players and in the process make a lot of money for himself Wall Street analysts said. Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of directors meeting Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands to make a ton of money " said Andrew Shore analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street to describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling takeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per share. Gillette rose three to 40 today following a gain of three yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis of Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares adjusted for a split. For example a deal between Gillette and some other company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262 mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment. "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if someone else takes over Gillette " said Analyst Deepak Raj of Merrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happen but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45 dlrs per share." Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring Gillette. He said Perelman in the process of taking Revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's operations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlon has recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances Shore would not be surprised if some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN> RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR> American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston Purina Co &lt;RAL>. "Perelman is trying to put the company in play " said a Wall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if the company is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette to resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the board consenting what has changed between November and now " he said. Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on. "Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of calculation " he said. But he added "The Gillette board has to be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by shareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by Gillette he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial adviser. Reuter

Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus " Fildes told Reuters in an interview. "Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement " said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes. Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus but neither owns an equity position in the company said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields. As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents including interleukin-2 in development. Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe. "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe " said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market. Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business. Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms. But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies." Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture but to "keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves." Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years. "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership " said Fildes.

Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned. Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a U.S. Court in Orlando Fla. Monday. The company has sought a declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011 in light of the recapitalization. Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the case claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount of the debenture.

If the court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares. Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not required to issue common to debenture holders who did not convert prior to June eight.

19432,TEST,false,true,NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA,President Reagan's nominee as top policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets. David Ruder a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill. was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate as expected he will succeed John Shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2 000 employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone. By law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934 the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929 which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy later to become the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939 and William Casey who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

Allied legal advisor and director George Kern who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell decided against amending Allied's SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29 Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8 even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7 the complaint said. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock or 48 pct of the total in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct which a federal judge allowed to be completed gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it became a subsidiary of Campeau it still files annual and quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. Reuter

19828,TEST,false,true,SAN FRANCISCO  NOT REGION  HURT BY RESTRUCTURING,Corporate mergers and acquisitions in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy a leading business-backed organization said. The Bay Area Council a group of more than 300 business firms said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986 but another 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status. Ted Hall a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California. However Hall said that only about 36 000 jobs had been lost in the region while more than 600 000 new jobs were created during the period. At the same time he said the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California. Council President George Keller who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp. told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area. "It's a great place to run a business " he added "but it's a hell of a place to do business with government." The study concluded that Chevron which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984 would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach Memorex Southern Pacific Castle &amp; Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer Pacific Telesis McKesson Tandem Computer U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that partly due to corporate restructuring the rate of job growth in San Francisco has slowed since 1980. In addition it said that the loss of corporate leadership had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and charitable activities. Reuter

Under the agreement the companies said Continental will acquire General Tire including its related domestic and foreign operations and Gencorp will retain liability for the medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired on or before November 30 1984. The sale is expected to be completed on or before November one and is subject to meeting certain conditions. Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last year the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs with 1.9 billion dlrs generated by its tire operations. Last year General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs and Gencorp had operating profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs. GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire employees under the agreement. Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt. In April GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase of up to 54 pct or 12.5 mln shares of its common at 130 dlrs a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs As part of the restructuring GenCorp also said it planned to sell its tire business the bottling operations of its RKO General Inc subsidiary and RKO's remaining broadcast properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive components businesses. Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company including general tire. "The price paid for General tire would not cause us to reevaluate that estimate " said Tilden. General Tire employs 10 000 people worldwide and has four tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada. In a statemnet A.

Robins Co said its board has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group Inc &lt;ROR> merits further consideration. At the request of the board Rorer has agreed to extend until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H. Robins. After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last Thursday analysts forecast that the Robins family which holds control of the company would vigourously oppose any merger. But the analysts added that Robins desire to emerge independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon Shield related liabilities. After a failed first attempt earlier this year Rorer's latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln dlrs. Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated 1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320 000 claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the Dalkon Shield interuterine device.

19950,TEST,false,true,CITICORP &lt;CCI> SAVINGS EXTENDS CALIFORNIA REACH,Citicorp has extended its reach into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition of 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities CitiCorp Savings said. Thrift industry analysts said the move approved by the Federal Reserve board today is a plus for Citicorp and shows its serious intent to penetrate the California market. The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into Southern California where 34 of the 50 branches are located. Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California. "This marks our first major expansion in California particularly in the south " said Citicorp Savings President Edward Valencia in a statement. Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market but do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than Sears was in that market. "We do believe they will be a better competitor than Sears " said James Stutz Executive Vice President of Home Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD> based in San Diego. Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as groundwork to establish Citicorp throughout the California market well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to convert the branches to banks at that time. In the near-term however analysts said with seven billion dlrs in assets Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in the thrift market against such large California thrifts as Home Federal Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF> H F Ahmanson and Co &lt;AHM> Golden West Financial &lt;GWD> and Great American First Savings Bank &lt;GTA>.

Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger plan. Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow. "Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only if it is permitted to assume immediate unconditional control of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its operations " Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC the federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers of interstate bus companies. But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways immediately. "The department has just begun to receive relevant information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the process of assessing the correctness of the company's allegations " acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said in comments submitted to the ICC. Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems. Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of Trailways' terminals buses and garages. The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that Trailways "could collapse in a matter of days." They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs with another six mln dlrs due June 30. The suppliers they said could force Trailways into bankruptcy "at any time." Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs and the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways fails to pay the interest due June 30 they said. Reuter

However the company said the plan will not be triggered by purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners a group controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman. It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed before they become exercisable at five cents per right. The company said the rights will expire on the later of February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics such as market accumulations which would interfere with its ability to maximize stockholder value. The rights become exercisable if any person or group acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding shares at 65 dlrs per share. It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its board. A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an official response to Edelman's bid by Friday Oct 23. Reuter

20744,TEST,false,true,BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V>,The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said it reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8 a Bank of New York spokesman said. "The offer still stands we have not changed our offer " a Bank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares. Earlier this month Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6 pct it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one Irving share. At that time the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition. "If it gets to the Irving shareholders they would approve it but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders " said Mark Alpert banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. "And the market is saying the deal won't go through " Alpert said. "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share then they won't go at a lower price " another analyst said. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer. However industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal. "With Irving's price so low Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders " said Michael Flores a consultant at Bank Earnings International a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry. "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed " Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank Alpert said. "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees " another analyst said. Reuter

In a suit filed in U.S. District Court International Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates who reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares tried to induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the Belzberg families of Canada. The complaint also discloses that on each occasion Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures. Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the market place according to the suit. The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be determined. In addition Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners from acquiring any more stock or voting the shares it reportedly owns the suit said. According to Multifoods the actions proposed by Bregman Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full benefits of the company's restructuring. In the past three years Multifoods has substantially altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S. consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.
