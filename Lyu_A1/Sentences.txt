9000006|1|Commercial exploitation over the past two hundred years drove the great Mysticete whales to near extinction.
9000006|2|Variation in the sizes of populations prior to exploitation, minimal population size during exploitation and current population sizes permit analyses of the effects of differing levels of exploitation on species with different biogeographical distributions and life-history characteristics.
9000006|3|Dr. Stephen Palumbi at the University of Hawaii will study the genetic population structure of three whale species in this context, the Humpback Whale, the Gray Whale and the Bowhead Whale.
9000006|4|The effect of demographic history will be determined by comparing the genetic structure of the three species.
9000006|5|Additional studies will be carried out on the Humpback Whale.
9000006|6|The humpback has a world-wide distribution, but the Atlantic and Pacific populations of the northern hemisphere appear to be discrete populations, as is the population of the southern hemispheric oceans.
9000006|7|Each of these oceanic populations may be further subdivided into smaller isolates, each with its own migratory pattern and somewhat distinct gene pool.
9000006|8|This study will provide information on the level of genetic isolation among populations and the levels of gene flow and genealogical relationships among populations.
9000006|9|This detailed genetic information will facilitate international policy decisions regarding the conservation and management of these magnificent mammals.

9000031|1|Studies of chickens have provided serological and nucleic acid probes useful in defining the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in other avian species.
9000031|2|Methods used in detecting genetic diversity at loci within the MHC of chickens and mammals will be applied to determining the extent of MHC polymorphism within small populations of ring-necked pheasants, wild turkeys, cranes, Andean condors and other species.
9000031|3|The knowledge and expertise gained from working with the MHC of the chicken should make for rapid progress in defining the polymorphism of the MHC in these species and in detecting the polymorphism of MHC gene pool within small wild and captive populations of these birds.
9000031|4|Genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known to encode molecules that provide the context for recognition of foreign antigens by the immune system.
9000031|5|Whether a given animal is able to mount an immune response to the challenge of a pathogen is determined, in part, by the allelic makeup of its MHC.
9000031|6|In many species, an unusually high degree of polymorphism is maintained at multiple loci within the MHC in freely breeding populations.
9000031|7|The allelic pool within a population presumably provides diversity upon which to draw in the face of environmental challenge.
9000031|8|The objective of the proposed research is to extend ongoing studies of the MHC of domesticated fowl to include avian species experiencing severe reduction in population size.
9000031|9|Knowledge of the MHC gene pool within populations and of the haplotypes of individual animals may be useful in the husbandry of species requiring intervention for their preservation.

9000038|1|This research is part of an on-going program by the principal investigator and associates.
9000038|2|Topics in the following areas are to be considered: (1) controlled Markov diffusions and nonlinear PDEs; (2) asymptotic properties of nearly deterministic Markov processes; (3) financial economics applications; (4) singular stochastic control; (5) computational methods in stochastic control; (6) stochastic calculus of variations; (7) nonlinear estimation.
9000038|3|Analytical methods based on viscosity solution techniques for nonlinear differential equations as well as probabilistic methods will be studied.
9000038|4|These theoretical studies are the basis for applied problems ranging from decisions at the stock market level to the control of spaceships.
